allies had been incorporated with the Roman people‚ the limited
rights denoted by Latinitas were retained as a kind os reward which
could be bestowed on cities or districts outside Italy which had de-
served well of Rome, but on which she hesitated to confer the civitas3
it was thus quite clear what was meant by a ‘ Latin ;’ it was no longer
an ethnica] or geographical, but a legal term, and by Latinitas or ius
Latii was understood a limited citizenship, which in certain ways
might be converted into full citizenship of Rome. The lex Iunia
Norbana (ΑΛ). 19) enacted that slaves who had received their liberty
in some other way than by one of the three civil modes of manu-
mission (vindicta, census, testamentum), and who had hitherto re-
mained legally slaveS, though protected in the enjoyment of liberty
by the praetor, should possess this ius Latii, whence they were called
Latini Iuniani 3 but the lex expressly prohibited them from making a
will (Ulp. Reg. 20. 14, Gaius i. 22 sqq.)¹.

The character of the substantive law in the period intervening be-
tween the final constitution of the state and the fall of the Republic
is a subject important because it involves a discussion of the origin
and nature of the praetor’s indirect power of legislation, and of the
kindred distinction between ius civile and ius gentium. Ius civile is
one os the two contrasted terms in two celebrated oppositions of
Roman law, between which there is an intimate relation. It is op-
posed, firstly, to ius gentium or naturale in general, and in this con-
nection it is said (Dig. 41. 1. 1. pr.) to be ‘ius proprium civitatis
nostrae ς’ so too private law is described (Inst. i. 1. 4) as tripertitum,
‘ collectum est enim ex naturalibus praeceptiS, aut gentium, aut
civilibus! Secondly, it is opposed to the praetor-ian law which was
based on and drawn from the ius gentium: ‘ius civile est, quod ex
legihuS, plebiscitis, senatus consultis, decretis Principum, auctoritate
prudentium venit: ius praetorium est, quod Praetores introduxerunt
adiuvandi, vel supplendi, vel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia' (Dig. 1.
1. 7)². The proper meaning of ius civile is thus the peculiar in-

¹ Thus in the time of the classical jurists there were two kinds os Latins: (1)
the Latinitas of the Latini coloniarii, which was still to be found in some cities
on which the ius Latii had been conferred‚ and which contained the commercium
without any limitation; (α) Latinitas acquired by manumission, of which there were

four varicties: (a) Latius who were such under the lex Iunia Norbana, (b) slaves ,

manumitted under the age os thirty years without observance of the provisions of the
lex Aelia Sentia (Gaius i. 18-21), (c) slaves manumitted by a ‘bonitary ’ owner, or
by a true owner, while they were the subjects of a usufruct or pledge, (d) the
descendants os libertini whose Latinitas had been due immediately to manumission.
