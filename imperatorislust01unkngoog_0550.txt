5 38 INS T JT U T I ONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib.W.

20 Quaedam actiones mixtam causam optinere videntur tam
in rem quam in personam. qualis est familiae erciscundae
actio, quae competit coheredibus de dividenda hereditate:
item communi dividundO, quae inter eos redditur, inter quos
aliquid commune est, ut id dividatur: item finium regun-
dorum,. quae inter eos agitur qui confines agros habent. in
quibus tribus iudiciis permittitur iudici rem alicui ex litiga-
toribus ex bono et aequo adiudicare et, si unius pars praegra-
vari videbitur, eum invicem certa pecunia alteri condemnare.

21 Omnes autem actiones vel in simplum conceptae sunt vel
in duplum vel in triplum vel in quadruplum: ulterius autem

pose of assessing the damages, and if the value of the slave killed (e. g.)
had not been higher in the preceding year than at the actual moment of
his death. For legacies ad pias oausascf. p. 445 supr. and ξ 26 inf.

ξ 20. The functions of the judge in the iudicia divisoria are more fully
described in Tit. 17. 4—6 inf. The explanation of their being partly real,
partly personal, must be sought in the structure οἳ their formula in the
earlier period. This seems to have contained two intentiones, the first
in rem concepta, and followed by an adiudicatio (‘ quantum adiudicari
ex aequo et bono oportet iudex Titio adiudieato ’ Gaius iv. 42), the second
concepta in personam, and followed by a condemnatio (e. g. tum quicquid
ob eam rem alterutrum alteri dare facere oportet ex fide bona, eius iudex
alterum alteri condemnato). Mutatis mutandis, the whole formula was
repeated for each of the parties (e.g. each joint owner), whence Ulpian
calls these actions mixtae in another sense : ‘mixtae actiones, in quibus
uterque actor est’ Dig. 44. 7. 37. 1. Under Justinian they are in reality
in personam only, ari'sing quasi ex contractu, Bk. iii. 27. 3 supr. ε ‘finium
regundorum actio in personam est, licet pro vindicatione rei est' Dig.
ιο. 1. 1.

The last named action, which was as old as the Twelve Tables, and

had been regulated by a lex Mamilia and enactments of Constantine,
·Valentinian 11. and Theodosius Ι, was in Justinian's time limited to
disputes as to the boundaries of praedia rustica, Dig. ιο. 1. 4. 103 the
judge was assisted by experts (agrimensores) as assessors, and neither
party could plead usucapio unless it. had extended to thirty years.

§aL The expression in simplum, in duplum etc. concepta, which
refers to the condemnati0‚ is another trace of the survival of the formula
in the later procedure. Where a plaintiff sues for ‘id quod sua interest ’
the action is in simplum concepta, though the amount os this may far
exceed the verum rei pretium, Dig. 19. 1. 13. pr. ‘ Ulterius (quam in
quadruplum) nulla actio extenditur’ means no more than that in no
action does the law direct the recovery of more than four times the

· penal unit 3 for sometimes the penalty will have no fixed relation to the
value of the object, and so as a fact will be more than fourfold that value
