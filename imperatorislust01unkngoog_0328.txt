shall reconvey upon payment of the debt within a specified time:
‘ fiducia est cum res aliqua sumendae mutuae pecuniae gratia vel
mancipatur vel in iure ceditur’ Isidor. orig. 5. 25. The effect of the
transaction was thus to transfer the property in absolute ownership
(subject to the trust agreement) to the creditor: hence a striking
resemblance to the English mortgage of realty. Consequently, the
creditor could, subject to the terms of his fiducia, deal with it as he
pleased, though any gain he made by it until the debtor lost his right
of redemption went to reduce the principal debt: ‘ quidquid creditor
per fiduciariam servum quaesivit sortem debiti minuit’ Paul. sent.
rec. 2. 13. 2: he had the right of sale necessarily, as being dominuS,
though if he exercised this right before the day fixed for payment had
passed he did so at his peril, and of it he could not deprive himself
even by express agreement, Paulus l. c. 5. But the debtor, though no
longer owner, could still sell it as well: sor (Bk. ii. 1. 41 supr.) he
could not be compelled to transfer to the vendee until the latter had ·
paid the price, and with this he could redeem the property, and so
make a good title : but he could not sell to the creditor, for ‘ suae rei
emptio non valet.’ In the event of sale by the creditor the debtor
was entitled to any surplus after satisfaction of the deht, Paulus l. c.
1: and it seems probable that, in the absence of agreement to the
contrary, he might redeem the property at any time so long as the
creditor had not yet parted with it. Such contrary agreement usually
took the form of a foreclosure clause (lex commissoria), providing
that in desault of punctual payment the fiducia should lapse, and the
property vest absolutely in the creditor: this was prohibited sor all
forms of pledge by Constantine, but was reintroduced in a modified
forrn by Justinian. The remedy by which the debtor enforced his
rights against the creditor was the actio fiduciae, condemnation in
which· entailed infamia, Gaius iv. 182. The advantages of fiducia, as
a species of real security, lie in the fact that no subsequent dealing
with the property by the debtor can prejudice· the creditor, so that
collisions between different creditors become impossible: its faults
are mainly that only such kinds of property can thus be used which
admit of mancipatio or in iure cessio (by which provincial land was
excluded), and that the debtor was deprived of the use and enjoy-
ment of the object pledged. This last inconvenience, however, was
frequently obviated by his being allowed to receive it back on hire or
as precarium.

When possession had been raised to a legal interest by the praetor’s
introduction of special remedies (possessory interdicts) for its pro-
