Tit. 6.] DE ACTJONJBUS. *531

actionem ad eam rem persequendam: quippe ita proditae sunt
iure civili actioneS, ut quis dominium suum vindicet. sed quia
sane durum erat eo casu deficere actionem, inventa est a prae-
tore acti0, in -qua dicit is, qui possessionem amisit, eam rem
se usu cepisse et ita vindicat suam esse. -quae aetio Publiciana
appellatur, quoniam primum a -Publieio praetore in edicto pro-

commenced the usucapion of property without being able to complete it
because some other person had obtained possession, and so interrupted

its operation, before his title had become indeseasible, p. 187 supr. The
conditions of success were as follow:

(ι) The object must be capable of being acquired by usucapio or
prescription‚ 'Dig. 6. 2. 9. 5.

(2) The plaintiff must have had possession: ‘ ante traditionem,
quamvis bonae fidei quis emptor est, experiri Publiciana non poterit’
Dig. ib. 7. 6. By the edict the possession must have been acquired by
traditio: ‘ait praetor, si quis id, quod traditur ex iusta causa non a
domino et nondum usucaptum petet, iudicium dabo’ Dig. ib. 1.*; but by
construction the remedy was extended to modes os acquiring possession
generally: ‘quaecunque sunt iustae causae adquirendarum rerum, si ex
his causis nactires amiserimuS, dabitur nobis earum rerum persequend-
arum gratia haec actio’ Dig. ib. 13. pr. This rule, however, does not
apply in those exceptional· cases (e. g. sometimes in legatum) where
ownership vested without possession being actually delivered, Dig. ib. 1.
2. ; ib. 7. ·pr. Moreover, the possession must be usucapion possession :
it must have been derived ex iusta causa (p. 216 supr.)‚ Gaius iv. 36, and
be accompanied by bona fides, Dig. 6. 2. 1. pr. : whether throughout its
continuance‚ or only at its inception, is matter of doubt.

(3) Τὴε action can be brought with success only against a defendant
who possesses with less right than the plaintiff, and therefore neither
against the dominuS, Dig. 6. 2. 16. 17 (unless the case is one in which,
supposing the owner brought vindicatio against the possessor, he could
be repelled by a iusta excepti0, e. g. doli, rei venditae et traditae, or rei
iudicatae), nor against any other person whose possession is as righteous
in respect of bona fides, iusta causa, etc., as the plaintifl's had been,
unless both derived their possession from the same person, Dig. 6. 2.‚

The actio Publiciana could be used to establish servitudes no less than
dominium: ‘si de usufructu agatur tradit0, Publiciana datur, itemque
servitutibus urbanorum praediorum per traditionem constitutiS, vel per
patientiam, sorte si per domum quis suam passus est aquaeductum
transduci: item rusticorum, nam et hic traditionem et patientiam
tuendam constat ' Dig. 6. 2. 1 ι. 1. The Publicius by whom the action was
introduced was perhaps the Quintus Publicius who is mentioned by
Cicero as having been praetor circ. B.c. 66 ε pro Cluent. 45. 1t was in
existence certainly in the time of N eratiu3‚ and perhaps of SabinuS, Dig.
6.,2. ¹5 and ¹7·
