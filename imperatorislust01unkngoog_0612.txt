swear ‘non calumniae causa se ad inficias ire’ only where he was not
restrained from vexatiously defending the action by some other re-
cognised motive, such as the penal sponsio in condictio certi and the
actio de constituta pecunia, the duplication of damages in some actions
on denial of liability, or the penal nature of the action itseli} Gaius iv.
172. B'y Cod. 2. 59. 2 Justinian required the oath from all defendants
and their advocates,

By a defendant’s ‘allegationes ² are to be understood the evidence and
arguments in support of his contradicti0‚ Cod. 3. 1. 14. 1. The oath was
taken on the Bible, ‘ sacrosanctae scripturae ’ Cod. loc. cit. The primm-y
juristic signification of ‘instantia’ seems to be ‘keenness,' ‘energy’ (‘dili-
genti studio instantiaque complere opera’ Cod. 8. 12. 22, ‘ stricta instantia
salsum arguere paratus' Cod. 9. 22. 24), whence it comes to mean, as
here, a contentiori (‘ believing that his contentiori in defence is honest ³).

For the actions in which it was said ‘ adversus inficiantes lis crescit in
duplum’ see on Bk. iii. 27. 7 supr.: cf. Tit. 6. 19 and 26 supr. The
actions to which Justinian alludes, in which ‘adversus inficiantem lis
crescit in triplum,’ are unknown3 those on furtum conceptum and obla-
tum (p. 501 supr.) were in triplum ‘sive quis neget sive fateatur‚’ and the
triple penalty in Tit. 6. 24 supr. did not apparently result from a denial
of liability.

In the earlier procedure vexatious litigation in plaintiffs had been
restrained in sour ways: ‘actoris quoque calumnia coercetur modo
calumniae iudicio, modo contrari0, modo iureiurandO, modo resti-
pulatione ’ Gaius iv. 174. In actions where there was a sponsio poenali3‚
the defendant could require that the plaintiff should promise him by
restipulatio an equivalent sum in the event of his being unable to prove
his case. In other suits, if absolved, he could osten bring against
him an action in the nature of ‘malicious prosecution.' By the actio
calumniae he might recover ᾗ, (in interdicts ἦ) of the value in dispute
in the previous action, but had to prove that the other had sued him
knowing that he had no ground of action, ‘calumnia enim in adfectu
est' Gaius iv. 178. By the contrarium iudicium, which was an alter·
native to this, but which lay only against an unsuccesssul plaintiff in
certain specific actions (e. g. iniuriae, Gaius iv. 177), and in which it was
unnecessary to prove malice, he could similarly recover damages
equivalent to some fraction of the amount claimed in the previous
action. Neither of these iudicia, however, lay, nor could the defendant
claim a penal restipulatiO, if he had compelled the plaintiff to take the
iusiurandum calumniae, i. e. to swear that to the best of his belief he had
a good ground of action, Gaius iv. 181.

Under Justinian the penal sponsio and restipulatio in the two actions
