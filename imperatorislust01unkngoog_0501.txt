INTRODUCTION TO BOOK JV. 489

It is pointed out that a wrong of this sort may be inflicted upon one
in the person of one's wife, children, or slaves; for though the slave
himself has no rights whatever, and therefore no good name to injure,
yet the object of an attack upon him may be to dishonour his master.
The penalty for this offence, originally in some cases retaliatory, had
been altered by the praetor to a pecuniary mulct, which the inJ'ured
person was allowed within certain limits to fix himself3 the considera·-
tions upon which its amount depended were in the main his rank and
the circumstances under which the injury had been inflicted, which
would sometimes bring it within the category of iniuria atrox. Among
minor points touched upon in the text are the bearing of the lex
Cornelia upon this subject, the alternative criminal remedy‚ the lia-
bility of accessories and instigatorS, and the extinction of the actio
iniuriae by dissimulatio or condonation.

The fifth Title illustrates the class of obligations which arise quasi
ex delict0, and which seem mainly to be cases of vioerious responsi-
bility, such as that of a householder for damage caused by things
‘ effusa et deiecta' from his residence, and of an inn or stable keeper
for the delicts of his emplwe's. The reason why a judge was held
liable quasi ex delicto for loss occasioned to suitors by his incapacity

· or injustice would seem only to be that such an offence could not

be brought within the definition of any of the four old established
DelictS.

At Title 6 we enter upon the discussion’ of the last department os
Private Law— the ius quod ad actiones pertinet. The division os law
into law of Persons and law of Things is perhaps as old as Cicero
(Invent. i. 24), and apparently was the basis of a classification in the ’
Perpetual Edict (Dig. i. 5. 2) 3 but GaiuS, so far as we know, was the
first jurist who added the third division of actiones. It may be
doubted whether his own conception of this branch of his system was
as clear as a more modern writer might have made it. The term
actio, as is shown in the note on Tit. 6. pr„ has a variety of meanings
in the writings of the Roman lawyerS, and two of them seem to be
more or less blended in Gaius’ fourth Book, which wholly relates to
this topic. In one sense, actio is a right of action; and a treatise
upon rights of action would correspond with what writers on analy-
tical Jurisprudence term the Law of Sanctioning or Remedial
rights. In another sense actio means the Procedure in an action;
taken thuS, the ius quod ad actiones pertinet would correspond to
what the same writers call Adjective Law, and which it is perhaps
more proper to regar-d as a part of the Public rather than of the
