INTRODUCTION TO BOOK I.

Tm: first two Titles of this book are merely introductory, and afford
no clue to the principle on which it is intended to distribute the rules
of the private code. Title 1 is derived in the main from the ‘ Institu-
tions ' of Ulpian3 it contains definitions of Justice and Jurisprudence,
determines the scope os the work as a treatise on private law, and
draws the distinction between ius naturale, gentium, and civile, which
has been adverted to in the general Introduction (p. 27 sq„ supr.). In
the second Title ius naturale is defined after Ulpian, and then ius civile
and ius gentium are distinguished in the words of GaiuS, though, as
has been pointed out elsewhere, the latter contrast is the true and
important one, and in other parts of the work ius gentium and ius
naturale are identified. The sources of the positive law of Rome are
then specified and each briefly described.

In the opening words of the third Title we meet with the significant
statement of the principle upon which the arrangement of the Insti-
tutes is to proceed. That principle, and, accordingly, that arrange-
ment, is taken literally from GaiuS‚ and an exposition of its meaning
will be as important for the work of the jurist as for that of the prince.
‘ The whole law by which we are governed relates either to personS,
or to thingS‚ or to actions! The division of the Institutes into these
three departments is perfectly clear; the ‘ius quod ad personas
pertinet' occupies Bk. i. Title 3, to the end ; the ‘ius quod ad res’
extends from the beginning of Bk. ii to Bk. iv, Title 5 ; the remainder
os Bk. iv ‘ pertinet ad actiones! In this particular point the Gaian
distribution is more satisfactory, as it makes the break between res
and actiones at the end of the third commentary, and devotes the
whole of the fourth to the latter subject 3 in the Institutes the formal
division of Books tends somewhat to obscure the material classifica-
tion of the system. This, however, though ‘ inelegans,’ presents no
obstacle to our comprehension of the system itself 3 but we are at
once met by difficultieS‚ and by great differences of opinion among
the commentators, when we attempt to discover the meaning of the
