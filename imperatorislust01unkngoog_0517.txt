Furti autem actio ei competit, cuius interest rem salvam 13
esse, licet dominus non sit: itaque nec domino aliter competit,
quam si eius intersit rem non perire. Unde constat creditorem 14
de pignore subrepto furti agere posse, etiamsi idoneum de-
bitorem habeat, quia expedit ei pignori potius incumbere quam
in personam agere: adeo quidem ut, quamvis ipse debitor
eam rem subripuerit, nihilo minus creditori competit actio
furti. -Item si fullo polienda curandave aut sarcinator sar· 15
cienda vestimenta mercede certa acceperit eaque furto amiserit,
ipse furti habet actionem, non dominus, quia domini nihil
interest eam rem non perire, cum iudicio locati a fullone aut
sarcinatore rem suam persequi potest. sed et bonae fidei
emptori subrepta re quam emerit, quamvis dominus non sit,
omnimodo competit furti actiO, quemadmodum et creditori.
fulloni vero et sarcinatori non aliter furti competere placuit,
quam si solvendo sint, hoc est si domino rei aestimat-ionem
solvere possint: nam si solvendo non sunt, tunc quia ab eis

the pater the filius, even aster he had left his power, Tit. 8. 6 inf.: but
the offender could be punished at once by invoking the aid of the praetor
is the thest was serious, Dig. 48. 19. 11. 1.

§ 13. The object of the actio furti was the recovery of the poena dupli
or quadrupli fixed by law, The rule as to who could bring it is simi·
larly laid down by Gaius iii. 203, and Paulus; ‘ furti actione is agere potest,
cuius interest rem non periisse ' sent. rec. 2. 31. 4. All os these statements,
however, are somewhat too wide: ‘neque . . . . cuiuscunque intererit,
rem non perire, habet furti actionem’ Dig. 47. 2. 14. 10 : the action lay at
the suit only of the owner, bona fide possessor, or person who had
detention of or some real right (e. g. usufruct, hypotheca) in the stolen
property less than ownership, and then only if he was prejudiced by the
thest. Hence the vendee before delivery was debarred from suing in his
own name, Dig. 47. 2. 14. pr.: ib. 80. pn, as also was the depositary
under ordinary circumstanceS, ξ 17inf., and all others who had merely
rights in personam in respect of the property stolen, e. g. the promisee in
a stipulation‚ Dig. 18. 1. 35. 4.

ξ 14. It seems at one time to have been doubtful whether the pledgee
ought to be allowed to bring actio furti if the pledgor was solvent
(idoneus) ; ‘ sed utrum semper creditoris interest, an ita demum, si debitor
solvendo non est? et putat Pomponius semper eius interesse pignus
habere, quod et Papinianus . . . probat ’ Dig. 47. 2. 12. 2. Papinian even

. thought that is two things were pledged sor one debt, and one of them

was stolen, the pledgee ought to be allowed actio furti even if the other
alone was adequate security, Dig. ib. 14. 5.
ᾧ 15. The clothes are at the risk of the fullo or sarcinator, Dig. 47. 14.
