Tit. 13] DE EXHEREDA T IONE LIBERORUM. 251

super adoptivis tuumne, continetur. Sed si expeditione oc· 6
cupatus miles testamentum faciat et liberos suos iam natos vel
postumos nominatim non exheredaverit‚ sed silentio prae-
terierit non ignorans, an habeat liberos, silentium eius pro
exheredatione nominatim sacta valere constitutionibus prin--
cipum cautum est. Mater vel avus maternus necesse non 7
habent liberos suos aut heredes instituere aut exheredare, sed
possunt eos omittere. nam silentium matris aut avi materni
ceterorumque per matrem ascendentium tantum facit, quantum
exheredatio patris. neque enim matri filium filiamve neque
avo materno nepotem neptemve ex filia, si eum eamve here-
dem non instituat, exheredare necesse est, sive de iure civili
quaeramuS, sive de edicto praetoris quo praeteritis liberis
contra tabulas bonorum possessionem promittit. sed aliud
ο eis adminiculum servatur, quod paulo post vobis manifestum
fiat. ·

was emancipated, he could only demand bonorum possessio contra
tabulas. Children given in adoption had to be either instituted or dis-
inherited unless the adoptio was plena (p. ¹30 and supr.)‚ Cod. 8. 48. pr. 1.

It is not clear what the words ‘ quod et praetores postea secuti esse
videntur ' refer to: perhaps to the bonorum possessio intestati, but more
probably to the bonorum possessio contra tabulas immediately before
the rescript of M. Aurelius, p. 247 supr.

§⁹1. The ‘adminiculum ’ referred to is the querella inofficiosi testa·
menti, for which see Tit. 18 ins.

Bonorum possessio contra tabulas, referred to in this Title, was
granted, not only to pretermitted liberi, but also, under certain eircum-
stances, (a) to the parens manumissor against the will of his emancipated
son, Bk. i. 12. 6 supr„ Dig. 37. 12 3 (b) to a patron and his agnatic de-
scendants against the will of his libertus (Bk. iii. 7 inf.) or liberta (Gaius
i. 192, ii. 122, iii. 43-4) ; (c) to a patroness against the will of her liberta,
Gaius iii. 52.

When granted to a descendant who was not disinherited by the
ancestor in the form required by the edict, its effect, if the praeteritus
was a suus, was practically to substitute intestate succession for succes-
sion under the will ς if not, its effect will appear more clearly from the
following :— ,

(1) Upon the pretermitted child demanding bonorum possessio, liberi
who were instituted heirs in the will came in with him under the grant
(commisso per alium edicto), and thus might be largely benefited is the
part in which they were instituted was less than their intestate portion,
Dig. 37. 4. 8. 14: but they could not take advantage os the bonorum
possessio if they had in any way accepted under the will. Liberi who
