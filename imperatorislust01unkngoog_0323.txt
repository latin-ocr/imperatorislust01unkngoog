non suisset, fideicommissum ex huiusmodi codicillis nullius momenti
efit’ ib. 3. 2), and as a general rule are read as part of the will itsels :
‘ codicillorum ius singulare est, ut, quaecunque in his scribentur, perinde
haberentur ac si in testamento scripta essent' Dig. ib. 2. 2. Occasionally,
however, the codicilli are looked at by themselves, and apart from the
will: ag. is the testator is insolvent, or less than twenty years of age, at
the time os executing his will, and then subsequently, when solvent or over
that· age, manumit a slave by codicilli, the manumission holds good,
though it would have been invalid if made in the will, Dig. 29. 7. 4, ib. 1.

There were at one time important differences in'effect among codicils
according as they were or were not confirmed, antecedently or subse·
quently, by a will. By unconfirmed codicils fideicommissa alone could
be created: by codicilli confirmati the testator could give legacies (Gaius
2. 270, Ulpian, reg. 2 5. 8), appoint testamentary guardiam, Dig. 26. 2. 3.
pr„ and directly manumit his own slaves ε but under justinian little -re-
mained of these distinctions except that relating to tutoris datio.

1 t was usual sor wills to contain a ‘ clausula codicillariS,' by which the
testator declared his desire, that if the will should prove invalid on any
ground it should have force as codicilli. Such declaration might be in
any form, and need not even mention the word codicils τ’* ex his verbiS,
quae paterfamilias scripturae addidit: ταύτην τὴν διαθῆκην βούλομαι εἶναι
κυρίων ἐπὶ πάσης ἐξουσίας, videri eum voluisse omnimodo valere ea quae
reliquit, etiamsi intestatus decessisset ’ Dig. 29. 7. 29. 1. By this clause
the dispositions of the will were validated only so far as they would have
held good had they been originally executed as codicilli ε thus they fell
to the ground unless the forms required sor the execution of codicils
(3 inf.) were observed, oris the testator had not testamenti factio: ‘ sei-
endum est eos demum fideicommissum posse relinquere, qui testandi ius
habent ² Dig. 30. 2. Subject to this, the effect of the clausula was to con-
vert the institution of the will into a fideicommissaria hereditas, Dig. 31.
88. 17, binding on the intestate heirs, or those instituted in an earlier or
later testament. If, however, the ground of the will’s invalidity was vio·
lation of the rules relating to the legitima parS, the institution became
altogether void. The legacies and fideicommissa remained good in any
case. .
§ 2. Nothing can be done by codicils affecting the direct universal
succession. To what is said in the text it may be added, that no invalid
institution could be validated by a codicillary confirmation, however
