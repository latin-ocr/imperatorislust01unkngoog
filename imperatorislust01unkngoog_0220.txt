stipulationibus id efficere debet. potest etiam in testamento

pactio et stipulatio was the sole mode os contractually creating servi-
tudes of every kind.

There is much difference os opinion as to whether, in addition to the
pactio et stipulati0, a quasi-traditio os the right was required to endow
it with the full proportions of a servitude. Gaius expressly says (ii. 28)
that servitudeS‚ like res incorporales in general, do not admit os traditio ;
but is the latter be conceived as the granting os the physical control over
a reS, or as the permitting it to be enjoyed, servitudes will also admit
of this figurative operation, and accordingly many hold that as boni-
tarian ownership at least could always be conveyed by traditio proper,
so pactio et stipulatio required the supplement os this quasi· or figura-
tive traditio to gain suli praetorian protection for the right created, as a
‘real ’ right. For instance, it is affirmed that this traditio gave a quasi-
possession, entitling the recipient to use the Publician action, as well as
the actio confessoria‚ whereby he was exempted from the onus of proving
his transferor's title, and which availed also against non—owners of the
praedium serviens. lt is quite certain that in many passages (e. g. Dig.
6. 2. 11. 1 ; 7. 1. 25. 73 7. 4. 1. pr. 3 7. 6. 3; 8. 1. 20) traditio is specified
as a mode of creating servitudes ς but obviously it must have been pre·
ceded by agreement, and the question is whether a real right could be
created by the latter unsupplemented by the former. There is no pas·
sage in the authorities which affirms the necessity of traditi0, and the
prevailing view now seems to be that it was not essential; though the
contrary is still maintained by some who argue from the jural impossi-
bility of creating real rights by a conti-act ‘in the proper sense of the
term,’ and explain the absence of passages affirming the necessity of
traditio by the consideration that in the time of the classical jurists
servitudes were, iure civili, not thus created at all.

The other modes in which servitudes in general could originate are :—-·

(1) Testamentary disposition or legacy; this was commonest in per-
sonal servitudeS‚ especially usufruct, which could either be bequeathed
directly (Tit. 4. 1 inst), or the heir could be directed to create it in favour
of the legatee: ‘ususfructus uniuscuiusque rei legari potest, et aut ipso
iure constituetur aut per heredem praestabitur: ex causa damnationis
per heredem praestabitur, ipso iure per vindicationem’ Paul. sent. rec. 3.
6. 17. Bequest of praedial servitudeS‚ to be duly constituted by the heir,
is spoken os in this section ; cf. Dig. 8. 4. 163 33. 3.

(2) Deductio ; reservation of the servitude in conveying the dominium
either inter vivos or by will; Tit. 4. 1 ins„ Dig. 8. 2. 34 and 35 3 8. 3.
30 and 33.

(3) Judicial decision, either (a) by adiudicatio in a iudicium divisor-ium,
Bk. iv. 6. 20 ; ib. 17. 4 and 5 inf.; (b) declaring a servitude duly consti-
tuted as against a recalcitrant defendant who refuses to create it hirn-
sels ς or (c) reviving by ⁴ in integrum restitutio' a servitude which has
been lost, Dig. 8. 5. 8. 4.

(4) In certain cases usufruct arose ipso iure in virtue os statutory
enactment (lex); e. g. the pater's usufruct in the peculium adventitium
