312 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR.

3 directo potest. Codicillos autem etiam plures quis facere
potest: et nullam sollemnitatem ordinationis desiderant.

expresS‚ Dig. 29. 7. 2. 43 though such confirmation, and also pupillary
substitutions made by codicils‚ would be upheld by a ‘benignior interpre-
tatio’ as fideicommissa, Dig. loc. cit. ; 36. 1. 76. So too the heir’s name,
which the testator had omitted or suppressed in a will, might be supplied

- in later codicilli, Dig. 28. 5. 77: and in the same way a testator might
declare the institutus of an earlier will indignus, whereby his portion was
forfeited to the fiscus, Cod. 6. 35. 4. Soldiers were exempted from the
restrictions of this section, Dig. 29. -1. 36. pr.

ξ 8. sse statement of the text that codicilli were subject to no require·
ments of form is misleading: all that it means is that they could be ex-
pressed in any phrase or language. Constantine prescribed for intestate,
and Theodosius 11 for all codicils the same number and qualification of
witnesses as were necessary for a testament. Under Justinian they had
to be signed by the maker before at least five witnesseS, Cod. 6. 23. 28. 1,
and to be signed and sealed by the latter in his presence ε many wfiters,
however, hold that seaiing was unnecessary. If these formalities were
not complied with, the procedure described in Tit. 2 3. 12 supr. might still
be appealed tn, so far as the would-be codicils could be construed as
creating a fideicommissum.
