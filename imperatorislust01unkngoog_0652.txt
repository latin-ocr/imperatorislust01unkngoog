obligation of the appellant to pay quadruple costs to his opponent if

The simplest mode of executing a judgment for a liquidated sum
would seem to be to seiae, by state agency, a sufficient amount of the
debtor’s property, and from the proceeds of its sale to satisfy the
creditor’s claim; should his property be insufficient, to make him a
bankrupt. Putting aside the exceptional application of pignoris capio
in the legis actio period, this distinction between execution for debt
and execution in bankruptcy was not recognised by the Romans
until the Empire. If a man would not satisfy a judgment which had
been recovered against him, there was no alternative but to proceed
as in a case of genuine insolvency. For a very long while indeed
the Romans did not even allow at all that direct and immediate
execution upon a debtor’s property which seems the natural and
reasonable mode of satissying a creditor’s claims: with true legal
conservatism they clung closely to the conception of an obligation
as a persona! right, a right which availed only against the debtor's
person, and not against property of any kind: sor immediately it con-
ferred any right against the property, it ceased, pro tanto, to be an
obligation. It is the person, they said, who is obligatus, and it is
the person to whom the creditor must look to be paid; there is no
execution except personal execution, and it is for the debtor to say
whether he will save himself by sacrificing his property ¹.

The earliest execution procedure is that of manus iniectio as regu·
lated by the Twelve TableS, which is described at length by Mr. Poste
in his note on Gaius iii. 77. As has already been observed, its seve-
rity was mitigated by a lex Boetelia, and, though abolished as a legis
actio by the lex Aebutia, it was retained in its milder form by tho
praetor under the formulary system, during which the damnatus in an
actio iudicati, if the debt remained unpaid for thirty days, was brought
before the magistrate, and unless he discharged it at once, or gave
security ‘iudicatum solvi ' through a vindex who undertook his defence,
he was ‘ addictus ’ to the creditor, and remained in a condition of quasi-
servitude until by his own labour or the intervention of friends the
debt was extinguished.

As distinct from this personal execution, execution against the
property was first employed only in the case of debts owed to the
state. If a man were condemned upon a criminal charge to a pecu·
