16 INTRODUCTION.

the genius of each is supposed to have reflected and reproduced
itself in their legal habits and in their modes of life and thought. Such
speculations assuredly cannot claim our serious attention; but a
question which is suggested by them is of larger interest, because the
answer to it will affect our judgment upon the general character of
the legal system through a -great part of its history, and will deter-
mine our explanation of many of its most peculiar phenomena. It is
the view of many who have deeply studied the institutions of Rome
that, in its infancy, the consciousness of the people as a military state,
which had perpetually to be defending its very existence with the
. sword, asserted itself so irresistibly as to colour the law of Rome to
the very end of its history. In periods of grave national peril citizens
always realise most fully their membership one with another, and are ·
most ready to sacrifice the fleeting interest of the individual to the
higher and more engrossing requirements of the state. Hence is
inferred a fact which (as it is represented) left its mark upon Roman
law even in the age of Justinian‚ twelve hundred years after the epoch
which we are now considering 3 the fact, namely, that in the earliest
period of the nation's history almost every relation with which juris-
prudence has ever had any concern was dominated by public law, or
by the idea, expressing itself in law, that beside, or apart from, the
state, the citizen is as nothing, and that he has no ground for com-
plaint if his family life, his religion, his dealings with his fellow men,
his very liberty and life are treated principally as means to the end of
government‚ and placed under state control. The position of the
family in the state econdmy has been already indicated. The very
existence of the people, as an organic whole, ⁸depended on the main-
tenance of the gentes through familie83 and as a new family could
arise only from the lawful wedlock of two citizens, marriage was made
a public act and placed under sacerdotal supervision; the solemn rite
of confarreatio (Gaius i. 1 12), by which alone it could be con·-
tracted, was a ceremony of deep public and religious import.
Again‚ through lack of children, or through the death of such as
might be born, a family might be in danger of dissolution 3 hence
the supreme political importance of the institution led to the recog·
nition of adoption as an artificial means of perpetuating its existence;
and adoption, too, was a public act, accomplished under the auspices
of the priestly college before the comitia centuriata.

There is perhaps less probability in the alleged extension to the
field of property of this domInation of public over private law. The
old principle of law, it is said, laid it down that conquered land and
