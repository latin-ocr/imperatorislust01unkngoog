intellegit quid agit. Pupillus omne negotium recte gerit: ut 9
tamen, sicubi tutoris auctoritas necessaria sit, adhibeatur tutor,
veluti si ipse obligetur: nam alium sibi obligare etiam sine
tutoris auctoritate potest. Sed quod diximus de pupilliS, 10
utique de his verum est, qui iam aliquem intellectum habent:
nam infans et qui infanti proximus est non multum a furioso
distant, quia huius aetatis pupilli nullum intellectum habent:
sed in proximis infanti propter utilitatem eorum benignior
iuris interpretatio facta est, ut idem iuris habeant, quod
pubertati proximi. sed qui in parentis potestate est impubeS,
nec auctore quidem patre obligatur. Si impossibilis condicio 11

ς 10. Infantes are children under seven years of age: ‘si infanti, id
est minori septem annis ' Cod. 6. 30. 18 pr., ‘prima aetas infantia est . . .
quae porrigitur in septem annis' Isidor. orig. 11. 2. Pubertas was
fourteen in maleS, twelve in femaleS, Bk. i. 22. pr. supr.; but to the
question when an impubes ceased to be infanti proximuS, and when he
began to be pubertati proximuS, no clear answer is to be found in the
texts. Savigny rejects the view, of· those who would decide this by· ·
dividing the seven (or five) years immediately succeeding infantia into
two equal portions on the ground that, on the clear meaning of the
termS, there must be an interval in every child's life when he is neither
infantiae nor pubertati proximuS, and inclines to the opinion that children
would be infantiae proximi during the year next after they ceased to·
be infanteS, and pubertati proximi during that immediately preceding
pubertaS.

It would seem that originally a pupillus could perform no legal act
without his guardian's auctoritas. The inconvenience which this entailed
under the old law, which would not permit its solemn dispositionS, man-
cipati0, in iure cessi0, stipulati0, etc. to be made by agentS, led to a
relaxation of the rule so far as to allow an impubes who was pubertati
proximus to act for himself in all transactions whereby he could not be
pecuniarily prejudiced (Bk. i. 21. pr. and notes supr.) ; and eventually by
the ‘benignior iuris interpretatio ’ referred to in the text the same pri-
vilege was extended to all pupilli after attaining their seventh year.
Consequently, any pupillus above that age could perform any and every
legal act with his guardian's auctoritas: without it he could only ‘ me-
liorem suam condicionem facere,' and so could be promisee, but not
promisor, in a stipulation z bilateral contracts which he entered into the
guardian could either ratify or repudiate, subject to what has been already
said on Bk. i. 21. pr. For the liability of an impubes on delict see on
Bk. iv. 1. 18 inf.
