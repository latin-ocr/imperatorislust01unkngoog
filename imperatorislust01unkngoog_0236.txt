voluntatem scriptis aut sine scriptis manifestaverit: et ad
exemplum venditionis nostra constitutio eas etiam in se
habere necessitatem traditionis voluit, ut, et si non tradantur,
habeant plenissimum et perfectum robur et traditionis neces-
sitas incumbat donatori. et cum retro principum dispositiones
insinuari eas actis intervenientibus volebant, si maiores ducen-
torum fuerant solidorum, nostra constitutio et quantitatem
usque ad quingentos solidos ampliavit, quam stare et sine
insinuatione statuit, et quasdam donationes invenit, quae pe-
nitus insinuationem fieri minime desiderant, sed in se plenis-
simam habent firmitatem. alia insuper multa ad uberiorem
exitum donationum invenimuS, quae omnia ex nostris consti-
tutionibuS, quas super his posuimuS, colligenda sunt. sciendum
tamen est, quod, etsi plenissimae sint donationeS‚ tamen si
ingrati existant homineS, in quos beneficium collatum est,
donatoribus per nostram constitutionem licentiam praestavi-

mus certis ex causis eas revocare, ne, qui suas res in alios
contulerunt, ab his quandam patiantur iniuriam vel iacturam,

performance, is the gift, for persor-mance can be enforced by action, and
‘ donari videtur quod nullo iure cogente conceditur’ Dig. 50. 17. 82. Such
promises originally were not actionable unless made by stipulatio : Anto-
ninus Pius made a mere formless promise actionable between parents
and children (fragm. Vat. 314) 3 and, as appears from this section, Jus-
tinian extended this to all persons whatsoever : ‘ non ex hoc inutilis sit
donati0, quod res non traditae sunt, nec confirmetur ex traditione
donatio' Cod. 8. 54. 35. 5.

Gists inter vivos were not as a rule revocable, like those made mortis
causa. By the old law, the pater or patronus might revoke gifts to an
emancipated child or libertus during their joint lives (fragm. Vat. 272),
but this right was limited by Diocletian and succeeding emperors to
cases in which ingratitude could be proved, or where children were sub-
sequently born to the donor. Justinian, as he here sayS‚ while permitting
all donors without distinction to revoke on the first of these grounds,
carefully specified the acts which amounted to legal ingratitude, Cod.
8. 56. 10.

Gifts were forbidden between husband and wife by customary law,
‘ne mutuo amore invicem spoliarentur’ Dig. 24. 1. 1. Allusion is also
made in this section to the invalidity ofgifts exceeding a certain maximum
unless made under prescribed forms. The oldest enactment on this
subject is the lex Cincia de muneribuS, B.c. 204, from the operation of
which, however, certain classes of persons were excepted on the ground os
kinship, affinity‚ patronatus, or the donor’s being the donee's guardian.
1t appears to have enacted that, as between personae non exceptae, gifts·
