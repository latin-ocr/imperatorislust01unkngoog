arbitrio adire hereditatem potest. Servus alienus post domini 2
mortem recte heres instituitur, quia et cum hereditariis servis
est testamenti factio: nondum enim adita hereditas personae
vicem sustinet, non heredis futuri, sed defuncti, cum et eiuS,

Here again there were exceptions on the ground of age and absence

“ (4) By the same statute, husband and wife who had no children by
the marriage could take under· one another-’s wills- only a tenth of what
was given them (lex decimaria), though the amount was increased by
the existence of issue by a· previous marriage, or if such issue had died.
Tbey were, however, entitled in addition to the usufruct of a third of the
residue from which they wem excluded. Portions which under these
last two statutes could not be taken by those for whom they had been
intended, became caduca, and* went in the first instance to co-legatees
with children, in the second, to instituted male heirs with children, in
the third, to male legatees with children, and in default of all, to the
treasury. These restrictions, however, no longer existed under Jus-
tinimi, the penaJties of coelibatus and orbitas having been abolished by
the sons of Constantine, Cod.8.16.1, and the lex decimat-ia repealed
by Honorius and·- Theodosius Cod. 8. 58. 2.

(5) Domitian disqualified feminae probrosae from taking either the
hereditas or legata, Dig. 29. ι. 41. 1, Cod.5.1.23. For· other disabilities
imposed on persons who married a second time, or on illegitimate while
legitimate children were living, see Cod. 5. 9. 6 and 10, N ov. 22. 27 and 28,
Nov. 89. 12, for- a different case, Tit. 17. 8 inf. Finally, the hereditas
or legata were sometimes ‘ erepta ’ from the person prima facie entitled
on the ground οἰ unworthiness (see Dig. 34. 9, Cod. 6. 35), the forfeiture
being sometimes in favour of the fiscus, sometimes in that of other
persons.

For the institution of serv-us proprius sine libertate see Gaius 1i. 186,
Bk.1.6. 2supr, Cod. 6. 27. 5.

§ 2. ‘Ibe opening words of this paragraph are ambiguous· , they may
refer to the institution of a slave actually at the time belonging to a
hereditas iacens (Dig. 28. 5. 52, ib. 64), or to an institution not to take
effect until the dominus of the slave instituted is dead, Theoph.

The institution osa servus alienus is at first sight enigmatical, for as
he could acquire the inheritance only for his master, why not institute
the latter at once? The solution is twofold. Firstly, the institution of
the slave secured the transmission of the inheritance to the heirs of his
master, whereas if the latter had been instituted himself and had pre·
deceased the testator, the institution would have lapsed: and this could
not be prevented by giving a ‘ remainder ' to his heire-by substitution, for
they were incertae personae; nemo est heres viventis. 'ro guard against
the contingency of the slave's own death in the' lisetime of the testator,
several slaves might be instituted. by way of substitution. The other
advantage of instituting a servus alienus will appear from a considera-
