576 INST JT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

2 et contra heredes transeunt. Superest ut admoneamuS, quod
si ante rem iudicatam is cum quo actum est satisfaciat actori,
officio iudicis convenit eum absolvere, licet iudicii accipiendi
tempore in ea causa fuisset, ut damnari debeat: et hoc oet,
quod ante vulgo dicebatur omnia iudicia absolutoria esse.

contractibus successores ex dolo eorum, quibus successerunt, non tantum
in id quod pervenit, verum etiam in solidum tenentur’ Dig. 44. 7. 12
(which disproves Theophilus' explanation of this passage by the actio
depositi) ‘et depositi et commodati et mandati et tutelae et negotiorum
gestorum ob dolum malum defuncti heres in solidum tenetur,’ ib. 49 ‘ex
contractibus venientes actiones in heredes dantur, licet delictum quoque
versetur! It may be that the passage was taken into the text of the
Institutes from Gaius without the obsolete example which alone could
give it a semblance of truth 3 but it is better to understand it of cases in
which fraud was not remediable by the ordinary action on the contract
(i.e. stricti iuris contracts) but only by the actio doli ; this being sup—
ported by Dig. 4. 3. 17. 1 ‘haec actio (doli) in heredem datur . . . de eo
quod ad eos pervenit.’ Upon this interpretation the expression ‘ ex con-
tractu actio' of course is loose3 all it means is that a delictual action
arising from fraud in contractual relations lies in heredem only so far as
the inheritance has been enriched by the fraud itself—a principle which
has been already stated.

There is no question of transmission when the action has once
reached the stage of litis contestatio; from that moment, whatever its
character, it bound and entitled the heirs of the defendant and plaintiff
respectively in every case.

ξ 2. The truth of the dictum ‘omnia iudicia esse absolutoria’ which
means that even where the defendant is proved to have been in the
wrong the trial must end in absolution ‘ si ante rem iudicatam satisfaciat
actori ² (Gaius iv. 114), had been disputed by the jurists. The Sabinians
had affirmed it in its entirety3 the other school admitted it in real and
bonae fidei actions, Gaius loc. cit., but from all others they had excluded
it as inconsistent with the duty of the iudex as laid down in the formula.
In this he was instructed to condemn the defendant if he found that, at
the date of litis contestatio, he was bound by the obligatio alleged by the
plaintiff : si paret . . . condemna. His duty therefore was plain: no
occurrence subsequent to litis contestatio could justify him in absolving

· the defendant if the plaintiff made out his case, not even full satisfaction
of the latter’s claim before the termination of the action. The only
liability of the defendant which could be cancelled by such satisfaction
was his liability as it existed before litis contestatio, and that had been
already destroyed by the novative operation of litis contestatio itself.
Thus the difficulty which the Proculians felt in admitting the maxim in
its generality arose entirely from the formula, and consequently with the
disappearance of the formula the difficulty disappeared aisn, and the rule
became universal.
