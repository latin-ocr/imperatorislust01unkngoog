therefore (all) Possession is equivalent to Equitable ownership, is
obvious.

Mr. Hunter seems to have been led into what we cannot but regard
as other than a completely wrong theory by not rigidly confining his
attention to Possession-—not this possession or that possession, but
all Possession-——whether bona fide or mala fidet His insurmountable
difficulty lies in the impossibility of identisying Possession, when
accompanied by mala fideS, with Equitable ownership. Upon mala
fide Possession he is inconsistent. In one passage (p. 205) he says,
‘the interdicts were open equally to mala fide possessors ς’ in another
(p. 200), “ the mala fide possessor of moveables had no right against
third persons? The latter statement, which is based solely on the
inability of a mala fide possessor to bring an actio furti or bonorum

. vi raptorum, is shown to be untrue, so far as interdicts are concerned,

by Savigny and by Dr. Walker (Selected Titles from the Digest‚
Introduction to Digest 41. 2): and interdicts are all that here we
need concern ourselves with3 other remedies are not for the protec-
tion of Possession at all. In fact, Mr. Hunter’s general position
seems defensible only to this extent, viz. that where a man has usu-
capion Possession, he also has Equitable ownership.

For a discussion of the question, to what part os the Roman system
the doctrine of Possession logically belongs see Poste, Gaius pp.
648 sqq.; and for the possessory interdictS, and the cases to which
they were individually applicable, Bk. iv. Title 15, and notes inf.
