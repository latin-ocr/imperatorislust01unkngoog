division into persona thingS, and actions, and to ascertain its relation
to other arrangements of private laW, such as those of Savigny (General
Introduction, p. 67 sq„ supr.) or os Austin and his school.

Our only business here is to ascertain what Gaius and Justinian
intended by ‘ ius quod ad personas pertinet.' It seems clear that the
only method by which this can be done is the analytical. Austin, it is
to be regretted, set in England the example of pursuing a ‘ high
a priori road’ in connection with this matter3 the principal sorm of
which is to adopt, as the leading division of law, that into ‘ the law of
persons ’ and ‘ the law of thingS,' though in a sense differing consider-
ably from that in which it was understood by the Roman lawyers, and
then either to find fault with the latter sor not having meant the same
as the writer, or to imply that they really meant the same thing,
though owing to the weakness of their legal philosophy they did not
adhere with any consistency to their own principle, and thereby com-
mitted most egregious faults of classification. Even if this be true, it
is probably a worse fault still to take a classical expression (such as
‘law of personS,' which to its authors, we may surely believe, meant
something perfectly precise), give it a new signification without
frankly confessing that a liberty has been taken ; and then to irresist-
ibly suggest that the two meanings are th‘e same, if the authors of the
expression really meant anything by it at all. To an English reader
the greatest difficulty, in the effort to understand the arrangement of
Gaius and Justinian, arises from Austin's perversiori of the expressions
‘law of persons ’ and ‘law of things’ sor the purposes of his own
system. If he had meant something totally different from them there
would have been no confusion3 but the very fact that his meaning
was somewhat the same, but at the same time somewhat different,
has surrounded the matter with difficulties, to remove which an
attempt will be made by pursuing a strictly analytical method, and by
attending strictly to the language of the Roman lawyers themselves,
without giving any fancy meaning to classical expressions whose actual
signification can be ascertained with tolerable certainty.

What did the Romans mean by ‘ persona ⁹? Itis clear there is some
relation between persona and homo ; sor the leading division of the ‘ius
quod ad personas pertinet ⁹ (i. 3. pr.) is that all men are either free or
slaves. Itis equally clear that they did not regard all men as persons;
it is not said all personS, but 311 men, are either free or slaves· SlaveS,
in fact, except very occasionally by a slip of the pen (e. g. Inst. i. 8. pr.)
are not regarded by the Romans as persons; an essential clement in
the idea os persona is the capacity of acquiring and possessing legal
