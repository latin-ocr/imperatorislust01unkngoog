By the important change to which he here alludes Justinian effected a
complete reformation in the Roman law of inheritance, so far as relates
to the character and liabilities of the heres. As Mr. Hunter says (Roman
Law p. 574), ‘it was a bold and successful stroke to convert the heir into
a mere official, designated by the deceased for the purpose of winding up
his affairs and distributing his property. The heir was now a mere
executor, with the privilege of being residuary legatee‚ and if the testator
did not forbid it, of retaining the Falcidian fourth?

By this enactment (eod. 6. 30. 22) Justinian gave the person to whom
the hereditas was delata, whether ab intestato or under a will, the option
between applying for a spatium deliberandi, and making a complete
inventory os the property os the deceased. If he chose the latter, he
must, with the assistance osa notary and a prescribed number of witnesses
representing the creditors and legateeS, begin the inventory within one
month of his becoming aware of his right, and finish it within two months
more: if, however, he was at a distance, he was allowed a year. During this
interval neither creditors nor legatees might molest him in any way,
though at its termination they could require him to swear to the accuracy
of the inventory‚ which he also had to sign. By selecting this procedure,
the heir was exempted from all liability beyond the assets of the deceased,
Cod. loc. cit. 4, and also from the obligation of ascertaining rights of
priority, etc. among creditors 3 these and legatees were to be paid in the
order in which they applied to him, and if the assets were exhausted un—
paid creditors might resort to paid legatees, Cod. ib. 4-8. The universitas
iuris in fact no longer passed to the heir: there was no confusio between
his proprietary relations and those of the deceased, so that iura in re
aliena and debts were no longer affected in the way described, p. 275 ευριπ,
Cod. ib. 9.

If the institutus or person entitled preferred to apply for a spatium
deliberandi, his old liabilities remained, ib. 14 t even in this case he must
make an inventory 3 is he did not, and accepted the inheritance, he lost
his right to the Falcidian fourth, and must pay legacies and fideicommissa
in full. The practical result, as Mr. Hunter remarkS, was that if there
was any doubt as to the solvency of the hereditaS, the heir was compelled
to make an inventory. ·
