breach was no longer tried or punished in the old manner3 they were
brought into connection with the ordinary procedure by iudex and
formula, and became merely a peculiar mode of commencing an ordinary
action or congeries of ordinary actions». The praetor, on a party’s appli-
cation, issued the interdict, by which ‘iubebat aliquid fieri aut fieri
prohibebat.’ Usually this was disregarded by the person to whom it was
addressed as a matter of course (Gaius iv. 14¹) ; whereupon the latter
was brought before the magistrate by the plaintiff, and the m'atter took
the form of an action in which the question for decision was in effect
whether, in defying the interdict, the defendant had really broken
the law. -

Interdicts which demanded production or restitution of property (ξ 1)
could be tried either by formula arbitraria or per sponsionem at the
defendant’s option, Gaius iv. 162—1653 the latter procedure involved a
penal wager of considerable amount, and consequently would perhaps be
preferred by a defendant who was convinced of the justice of his cause.
In interdicta prohibitoria there was no alternative3 the trial must be
per sponsionem, and, where the interdict was double (Gaius iv. 160, ξ 7
ἰαί), was peculiarly complicated, because each party played the rble of
both plaintiff and defendant, ‘nec quisquam praecipue reus vel actor
intellegitur, sed unusquisque tam rei quam actoris partes sustinet 3 quippe
praetor pari sermone cum utroque loquitur’ Gaius loc. cit. The pro-
cedure upon a double is in fact a duplication of that upon a single
interdict when tried per sponsionem, with one peculiar feature (the fructus
licitatio) of its own. The circumstances under which a double interdict
lay were where two persons claimed each to be entitled to the exclusive
present possession of the same object, moveable or immoveable. Here,
on their appearance before him, the praetor awarded the possession, on
a rough and ready principle, to one or other of them ; if the object was
immoveable‚ and the interdict was uti possideti3‚ to the one who as a
matter os fact was in possession at that moment3 if it was moveable,
and the interdict was utrubi, to the one who had been in possession the
greater part of the year next immediately preceding, Gaius iv. 148-152.
This award was immediately followed by the issue of the interdict proper,
which prohibited all disturbance of the possession so adjudged, Gaius
iv. 160.

It is clear that this adjudication might be altogether at variance with

the true rights of the case, and it was to try the true rights of the case—
to determine which of the parties was really entitled to the possession in

law—that all the proceedings had in reality been taken. Possibly it may · ·

have been hoped in the earlier time that the order would be obeyed
(Gaius iv. 139), and had this been so interdicts would have formed a

typical illustration of a summary process. But, as a matter of fact, the
issue of the interdict was almost invariably followed at once by a fictitious

dispossession or ejectment (vis ex conventu), which was a formal breach
