on to their opponentS. To prevent this the former could either bring
condictio ob causam datorum, compelling the holders to prove the
alleged consideration, or in default to deliver up the memoranda (Cod.
4. 30. 7), or protest in the acta of a court against their validity‚ οι· .
make their exceptio perpetual by serving a formal written notioe on
the creditor, Cod. ib. 14. 4.

Justinian, before whose legislation the exceptio pecuniae non
numeratae could be used only where default had been made in the
advance of money by the plaintiff, gave it a larger scope by allowing
it also where the alleged consideration was the conveyance of other
things : ‘ in contractibus, in quibus pecuniae vel aliae res numeratae
vel datae esse conscribuntur, non intra quinquennium, quod antea con-
stitutum erat, non numeratae pecuniae obicere possit, qui accepisse
pecunias vel alias res scriptus sit, vel successor eiuS, sed intra solum
biennium continuum ’ Cod. 4. 30. 4. pr. Justinian's attempt to pass
off the ‘ cautio ' as a ‘ literal’ contract, which is due merely to the
habit of reproducing, if possible, the arrangement and terminology of
Gaius, is forced and unhappy: the, notionf of· an obligation arising
simply literis does not appear elsewhere in· the Corpus iuriS‚ except
so sar as the use of scriptura and literae-in Dig. 44. 7. 2. 1 3 ib. 38,
and 46. 2. 17 may be regarded as a reminiscence of the old ex-
pensilatio. ·
