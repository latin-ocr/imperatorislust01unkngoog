the gens, the gens the family, the family the individual ; to belong to ¹

the first a man must also belong to the last member of the series; or·
rather we should say that primitive law takes little account os indi·
viduals, but of groups, that is to say, of families or gentes only.

The comitia curiata, and in fact the whole constitution, was based
on this family, gentile, and tribal organization. The comitia curiata,
which was the popular assembly, was composed of all the patres
familias of the gentes; it w'as thus a gathering of the heads of families
arranged >on the principle of real or fictitious relationship (Gellius xv.
27 ‘ quum ex generibus hominurn suffragium seratur, curiata comitia
esse ²). But the services of the great majority of ablebodied citizens
were constantly required by the military exigencies of a state which as
yet drew no distinction between a stranger and an enemy3 conse-
quently, to superintend the general conduct os affairs, there was a
council or senatus consisting, after Tarquinius Priscus, of three hundred
of the patres gentium, a hundred from each tribe. The principles of
democracy and oligarchy were thus both represented, and two ex-
amples may be illustrated to quote the ‘ system of checks and balances'
by which harmony was preserved between them. The nomination of
the king, or supreme executive magistrate, lay with the senate, but re-
quired confirmation by the comitia, which, by a lex curiata (Inst. i.
2. 6), invested him with an imperium of life-long duration‚ whereby
he became, externally, the leader os the hostin arms, internally‚ the de-
positary of the highest administrative functions of government. On
the other hand, it was to the populus alone, assembled in its comitia,
that the legislative function belonged, though this function could not
be called into action without the authority of the senate, which alone
possessed the right of submitting subjects sor deliberation, and of
initiating changes of law3 it was the populus which decided upon war
and peace, and which chose the king nominally, and· the senators
actually: but in the exercise os all these rights it had to wait for action
to be first taken by the probouleutic body, whose members it chose
itself, but whose personal constitution, when once selected, it could
modify only in a constitutional manner.

The origin of the other comitia was later in date. So far nothing
has been said to suggest that there were any inhabitants os Roman
territory who were not citizens—either themselves heads of familieS, or
subject to the potestas of a paterfamilias. From the very first, how· .
ever, there seems to have been a number of free persons dwelling
around the three tribes, and yet not belonging to them; abiding on
Roman soil, and therefore subject to the dominion of Rome, yet. pos-
