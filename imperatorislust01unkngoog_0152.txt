the will of a husband in whose manus she had been3 (2) tutores fidu-
ciarii, in case of a freeborn woman’s manumission e mancipio (Gaius
i. 115 a); (3) tutores cessicii3 (4) tutores Atiliani‚ appointed by the
magistrates. Testamentary guardians were as old as the XII Tables
(note on ξ 3 inf.); but in relation to women they resembled the four
kinds just specified in possessing but the shadow of those powers of veto
and control which belonged to a tuto‘r legitimus. The sanctiones a
tutor who was not legitimus was required to validate the woman’s dis-
positionS, wherever that of a statutory guardian would have been neces·
sary: ‘tutoris auctoritas necessaria est mulieribus quidem in his rebus:
si lege aut legitimo iudicio agant: si se obligent, si civile negotium
gerant, si libertae suae permittant in contubernio alieni servi morari, si
rem mancipi alienent’ Ulpian, reg. 11. 27 3 in 20. 15 he adds the execu-
tion osa will. But in all these cases the sanction was merely formal:
‘pupillorum pupillarumque tutores et negotia gerunt, et auctoritatem
interponunt: mulierum autem tutores auctoritatem duntaxat inter-
ponunt ² Ulpian, loc. cit. 25, and the auctoritas of a non-statutory guar-
dian could be demanded by the woman as a matter of right: ‘loquimur
autem de his scilicet feminis quae non in legitima parentium aut patro·
norum tutela sunt, sed de his quae alterius generis tutores habent, qui
etiam inviti coguntur auctores fieri ’ Gaius ii. 120, ‘saepe etiam [tutor]
invitus auctor fieri a praetore cogitur ' i. 190.

lt was in respect of making a will that the woman was most restricted,
the original rule being that no woman could do this who had not sub-
jected herself to capitis deminutio by coemption, followed by remanci-
pation and manumission, or, in other words, by a fictitious marriage,
Gaius i. 115 a3 she thus obtained a tutor fiduciarius, who authorized
the testament ‘dicis causa,’ ib. 190, though in all this business the in·
terests of the patron or agnates were completely secured, for without
their sanction at the first the coemption could not have taken place
at all.

The only independent women who were exempted by the older law from
perpetual guardianship were the vestal virgins, on whom this privilege had
been bestowed by the XII Tables, Gaius i. 145; but aster the fall of the Re-
public important changes were made, especially in respect os testamenta
The lex Iulia and Papia Poppaea, Α. D. 9, released from guardianship
all women who had borne a certain number of children (ius liberorum),
and this boon must have benefited a very large proportion of married
women who were sui iuris. Not many years later a law of Claudius en·
tirely abolished the legitima tutela of agnates over women,Gaius i. 157, and
by a senatusconsult passed under Hadrian they were enabled to make
a will without the necessity of a coemption, though the auctoritas of the
guardian was not dispensed with. Thus, in the time os the classica]
jurists, every woman who was sui iuris, and who was not a vestal virgin
or exempted under the lex Papia, must have a guardian: but his
