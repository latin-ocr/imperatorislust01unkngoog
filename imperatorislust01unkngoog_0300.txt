288 INSTJTUTJONUM LIBRI QUA TTUOR. [m. 11.

21 ex eo reliquas inferre. Tam autem corporales res quarn incor- ·

porales legari possunt. et ideo et quod defuncto debetur,
potest alicui legari, ut actiones suas heres legatario praestet,
nisi exegerit vivus testator pecuniam: nam hoc casu legatum
extinguitur. sed et tale legatum valet: ‘damnas esto heres
22 domum illius reficere’ vel ‘illum aere alieno liberare.’ Si
generaliter servus vel alia res legetur, electio legatarii est, nisi⁰
23 aliud testator dixerit. Optionis legatum, id est ubi testator ex
servis suis vel aliis rebus optare legatarium iusserat, habebat
in se condicionem, et ideo nisi ipse legatarius vivus optaverat,
ad heredem legatum non transmittebat. sed ex constitutione
. nostra et hoc in meliorem statum reformatum est et data est
licentia et heredi legatarii optare, licet vivus legatarius hoc non
fecit. et diligentiore tractatu habito et hoc in nostra consti-

The words ‘ et ex eo reliquas inferre ’ at the end os the section are in·
terpreted by Theophilus as part of the rescript, not of the will ε but it is
clear that they belong to the latter, the manumission being ex die, and
taking effect from the giving in of the slave’s accounts with his master,
the adverse balance being made up out of his peculium, ‘et quod reli-
quum est . . . solvere debet’ Dig. 35. 1. 111.

ξ 21. This is called legatum nominiS, nomen being the technical term
sor what we call a chose in action. The legatee could sue the testator’s
debtor by actio utilis, Cod. 6. 37. 18, and could also claim an express
assignment from the heres, Dig. 30. 44. 6. 1f the debtor paid the heir,
the latter could be compelled to transfer the amount so received to the
legatee ε if payment were made to the testator in his lisetime, the legacy
became void unless the will clearly disclosed a contrary intention, Dig.
32. ιι. 13, ib. 64

ξ 22. Where a res non fungibilis (sor which see on Bk. iii. 14 pr. ins.)
is bequeathed without further specification (e.g. a slave, a horse, a jewel)
it is technically called a legatum generiS. Unless there was evidence os
a contrary intention, such legacies were valid only (1) if the inheritance
actually comprised a thing or things os the genus bequeathed, Dig. 30.
71. pr„ and (2) if the genus was sufficiently definite : thus the legacy of
an estate is void, that of a house is valid‚ Dig. 23. 3. 69. 4. Under the
older law it would seem that as a general rule the legatee had the choico
of the object if the bequest was per vindicationem, the heir is it was per
damnationem ε but under Justinian‚ unless the testator directed other-
wise, the election always rested with the former, subject to the restrictiori
that he must not choose the best specimen of the genus. If the choice
was given to the heir, he might not select the worst : if to a third person,
he might choose neither the best nor the worst‚ Dig. 30. 37. pr.

ξ 28. justinian's enactment on this matter is in eod. 6. 43. 3.
