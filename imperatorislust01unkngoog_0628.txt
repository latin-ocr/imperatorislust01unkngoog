procedure. The complainant must observe a great number of forms

first step, we may say, in the process by which sels-medress slowa
yielded to the encroachments of courts of justice was the gradual
development of a body of ennom, in some cases extremely bulky,
precisely delining the conditione under which it might be exacted,
and minutely prescribing the proper stages in the process, without the
due observance os which the complainant must altogether lose his
remedy. Notioe of the intention to distrain—fasting upon the wrong.
doct—attendance of witnesses—-allowance of a ‘ stay ' or interval
between the earlier and later steps—and many other formalities are,
or may be, the essential conditions of success. Such limitation by
custom of the right of sels-redress-—in other words, its ‘ incorporation
with a regular procedure ’—is most common in societies, such as that
of the Irish as revealed to us in the Brehon ‘law tracta in which, even
if there be a judicial system at all, its action is παὶ and inter-mittent,
or where ⁸ courts of justice exist less for the purpose of doing right
universally than for the purpose of supplying an alternative to the
violent redress of wrong! But ‘ the Roman tribunals became the
organs of the national sovereignty at an exceptionally early date,
and the development of Roman law and procedure was exceptionally
rapid ; ¹ consequently, we are enabled to bridge over the gulf between
the primitive system os private vengeance‚ and the earliest Roman
civil process of which we have any knowledge, less by tracing this
gradual incorporation of sels-tedress with a regular procedure than
by other indications of more advanced ideas. These in the main are
three in number: the .introduction and development of the idea of
composition for injury3 the plan os guaranteeing a man’s rights by
collective action through .witnesses; and the contractual' decision of
disputes·

i. There can be little doubt that the term ‘ poena' originally meant
not so much penalty as composition for injury ς the earliest poenae
were sums in consideration of which the injured person consented to
forego his customary right of sels-tedress‚ and the penal sums re·
