Tit. aa] DE, ,LEGE FALCJDJA. 295

recusantibus scriptis heredibus pro nullo aut minimo lucro
hereditates adire. et cum super hoc tam lex Furia quam lex
Voconia latae sunt, quarum neutra sufficiens ad rei con-
summationem yidebatur: novissime lata est lex Falcidia,
qua cavetur, ne plus legare liceat, quam dodrantem totorum
bonorum, id est ut, sive unus heres institutus esset sive plures»,

esset, duobus heredibus institutis», veluti Titio et Seio, si Titii
pars aut tota exhausta, sit legatis„ quae §nominatim ab eo
data sunt, aut supra modum onerata, a Seio vero aut nulla
relicta sint legata, aut quae partem eius dumtaxat in partem
dimidiam minuunt, an, quia is quartam partem totius here·

quoted cll-Cic. de inv. 2. 50‚-Auctor ad Herenn. 1. 13, Dig. 50. 16. 120,
Ulpian,.reg. 11. 143 its content is pithily put by Gaius ii. 224 ⁶ quod quis-
que de re sua testatus esset, id ratum haberetur! - ·⁴

The lex Furia testamentaria, 3.(3. 183, imposed a penalty of four times
the excess upon any one (except the cognatas of the person by whom
the testator had been. manumitted or emancipated, Ulpian‚ reg. 28. 7),
who took as a legacy, or mortis causa, more than 1000 asses from the
same person: it is remarkable sor being the first enactment of the-civil
law relating to inheritance in which cognatio is recognised as a title.
As Gaius remarkS, it altogether failed in its object, ‘ qui enim verbi
gratia quinque millium aeris patrimonium habebat, poterat quinque
hominibus singulis millenos asses legando totum patrimonium erogare²
ii. 225. The lex Voconia, 13.C. 169 (Cic. pro Balbo 8, in Verr. 2. 1.-42‚
43, de senect. 5, de fin. 2. 17, de repub. 3. 10),·which Gaius regards· as an
attempt to provide a more effectual remedy against intestacy, seems
really to have been only a relaxation of* the lex Furia in favour of
wealthy testators ; any person ranked in the first class of the census as
owner of 100‚ooo sesterces or· upwards (Cic. in Verr. loc. cit.) might
bequeath away« as much as he pleased‚· provided no legacy or gift mortis
causa exceeded in amount the share which the heir (or each of two or
more co-heirs) received himself. Both stat-ntes were 'superseded by the lex
Falcidia, ne. 40, the terms of which ran as follows, ‘quicunque civis
Romanus post hanc legem rogatam testamentum faciet, is quantum
cuique civi Romano pecuniam iure publico dare legare volet, ius po-
testasque esto, dum ita detur legatum, ne minus quam partem quartam
hereditatis eo testamento heredes capiant’ Dig. 35. 2. 1. pr. The pro-
visions of the lex Falcidia were not extended to donationes mortis causa
till the time of Septimius Severus, Dig. 24· 1. 32. 1 ;- 31. 77. 1.
