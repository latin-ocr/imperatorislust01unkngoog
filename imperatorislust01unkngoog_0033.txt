NE W MA GISTRA CIES--LEGES LICINIAE. 2 1

with that os the comitia centuriata, but only that the tribal assembly
was established in the form in which it had existed, and with the
functions which it had enJ'oyed, before the regular constitution had
been suspended by the appointment of the commission of eodification.
One result of this restoration was that the patricians now began to
take part in the comitia tributa, which thereby gradually lost its
character as a merely plebeian assembly. Either by the same statute,
or by another carried by the same consuls, it was provided that in
future no new magistrate should be created from whose decisions there
should be no appeal (provocatio) to the centuries.

The measures by which the coveted ‘ exaequatio iuris ’ was finally
attained require a brief review. The lex Canuleia (mc. 445) legiti-
mated connubium between patricians and plebeians, and by uniting
the members of the two orders by the tie of blood rapidly paved the
way for the other enactments which at length welded them into an
united people, with identical interests, and equal one with another in
the eye os the law. Two years later was introduced the office of censor,
which immediately became of large political importance. The duty
of making out the lists of citizens in their various classes of course
involved a very considerable power of affecting the individual in his
political rights; thus, for instance, the censors were privileged to
exclude a man from the senate, to deprive an eques of his horse and
rank, or to remove a plebeian from his tribe, on account os desecta
not only of legal qualification but even of moral character3 while as
moribus praefecti they could lower his position in the eye of his

· know-citizens by the subscriptio censoria, or mark set against his

name in their official list—the sure indication of dishonesty or pro-
fligacy. Among the other functions through which they gained their
poliu'cal influence may be enumerated the administration of the public
revenues, the farming of the customs, and the making os all contracts
sor public works.

At the time of the passing os the lex Canuleia³ the plebeians had
sta-iven hard to gain access to the consulship, but their efforts had
been baffled by the patriciana, who, however, conceded that a new
magistr-acy should be established, ‘tribuni militum consulari potestate,’
to relieve the consuls of some of their duties, and to this new office
members os the plebs were to be eligible. At first it seems to have
been frequently held by plebeians, but by degrees the patricians
succeeded in making it almost as exclusively their own as the consul·
ship had ever been, and Livy represents (vi. 37) a tribune os the plebs
as saying in the year n. c. 369 that no plebeian had attained this
