collection of ruleS, embodied in the edict of the praetor peregrinus,
for the regulation of commercial transactions of peregrini at Rome,
either inter se, or with the citizens and allies of the Roman state. In
its original signification it is the law which Rome applied in favour of
the ‘ gentes‚’ the non-Roman peoples‚ whose members sought justice
at the hands of Roman magistrates; a law not binding any people
in particular, but supposed to bind all peoples in general, in their
private dealings with one another. As such, it had no validity sor
Roman citizens inter se ; their rights and obligations were determined,
in relation to one another, by the ius civile: ‘Nam quod quisque
populus ipse sibi ius constituit, id ipsius civitatis proprium est, voca-
turque ius civile, quasi ius proprium ipsius civitatis' (Gaius i. 1, Inst.
i. 2. 1): and we have already seen that the ius civile was a law based
on the religion and customs of the tace, which we may perhaps
believe was at first considered far higher and more precious than the
ius gentium or any other law whatsoever, and which accordingly the
Romans persistently refused to extend to anyone who was not himself
a citizen.

There can be little doubt that in the course of time a very great Φ
change came over the feelings with which the Romans, and especially
the lawyer claSS, regarded the law of all nations in contrast with their
own indigenous law. Sir Henry Maine (Ancient Law p. 52 sq.) has
fixed the date of this change as contemporaneous with the conquest
of Greece, and the importation of the Stoic philosophy to Rome. He
bas described the revolution which ensued upon the wide acceptance
of that philosophy in the West, and more particularly from the ardour
with which the lawyer class threw themselves into its study. He has
shown how its leading principle was life according to the law which
nature had once, in a sar-off age, laid down for the governance of
human relations, when states, and therefore civil law, had not begun
to exist, and which had become lost and forgotten in the artificia!
society of nations which prided themselves on their civilisation ; how
the Roman lawyers leapt to the conclusion that the ius gentium, with
its universal validity, was no less than this lost code of natur‘e, and
how, as was only consistent, they transferred to it all the affection and
veneration which hitherto they had bestowed on their own narrow and
exclusive municipal law. Attractive as this theory is, it is submitted
that it cannot be received without some qualification. Greece became
a Roman province in the middle of the second century before Christ:
but her philosophies were as yet regarded at Rome with dislike and
suspicion, and in ac. 161 their teachers had been expelled from the
