DE Auc‘rom‘rA‘rE TUTORUM.

Auctoritas autem tutoris in quibusdam causis necessaria
pupillis est, in quibusdam non est necessaria. ut ecce si quid
dari sibi stipulentur, non est necessaria tutoris auctoritas:
quod si aliis pupilli promittant, necessaria est: namque placuit
meliorem quidem suam condicionem licere eis facere etiam
sine tutoris auctoritate, deteriorem vero non aliter quarn
tutore auctore. unde in his causis, ex quibus mutuae obli-
gationes nascuntur, in emptionibus venditionibuS, locationibus
conductionibuS, mandatiS, depositiS, si tutoris auctoritas non
interveniat, ipsi quidem qui cum his contrahunt obligantur, at

linvicem pupilli non obligantur. Neque tamen hereditatem

proper remedy was the actio de rationibus distrahendiS, a penal action
by which double damages could be recovered, Dig. 26. 7. 55. 1 ε 27. 3. 1.9.

Tit. XXI. The administration os property in general is carried on by
‚dispositions such as alienation, contract‚ release, and so forth3 but the
functions of a tutor relate in the main only to acts or dispositions by
which the ward’s property might be diminished: with an act of the ward
by which he is merely enriched the tutor need have nothing to do. The
most important acts of the former class are alienation and contract:
these might (‘ si procuratorem recipiebant ’) be the acts of the tutor alone ε
but if the actus were legitimus the ward must act in person. But when-
ever the latter attempted to make a disposition by which his proprietary
position might be prejudiced, it could confer no rights on other parties
unless the tutor ‘auctoritatem suam interposuit ε’ it was this alone that
gave the act a full legal character: ‘tutoris auctoritas necessaria. . . si
lege aut legitimo iudicio agant, si se obligent, si civile negotium gerant
(e.g. hereditatis aditio, note on ξ 1) si rem mancipi alienent . . . etiam in
rerum nec mancipi alienatione tutoris auctoritate opus est ’ Ulpian‚ reg.
11. 27. There were in fact only three cases in which a pupil could be
sued on an act of his own which had not been sanctioned by his tutor:
(1) for his own delict, Dig. 9. 2. 5. 2; (2) si actio ex re venit, i.e. where
the obligation is merely one of restitution, Dig. 44. 7. 46: 13. 6. 32 ; and
(3) where and so far as he had been enriched by the transaction‚ Dig.
26. 8. 5. pr. He was also bound ‘naturaliter’ (1) by unilateral contractS,
Bk. iii. 29. 3 infi, though the creditor could not assert his claim by
exceptio or even by soluti retenti0, and (2) by bilateral contracts also,
the other party here being able to avail himself of all the ordinary in-
cidents of naturalis obligati0. Thus we must supply a word in the last
sentence of this section, and understand it ‘ at invicem pupilli [civiliter]
non obligantur.’
