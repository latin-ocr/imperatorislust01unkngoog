INTRODUCTION TO BOOK 11.

Wrrn the second Book of the Institutes we enter upon the discus·
sion of the ius quod ad res pertinet. Instead of giving a plain state-
ment of the contents of this branch of the legal system, Justinian
follows Gaius in presenting us with a number of very perplexing cross
divisions of res, which, however, only partially correspond with those
of the earlier writer, and from which we are left to gather by induc·
tion the meaning in which they both use the term when they make
it their basis of classification. In three of these divisions there is no
divergence between the two writers. Res are, firstly, either in patri-
monio nostro or extra patrimonium nostrum (G. ii. 1, Inst. ii. 1. pr.);
secondly, they are either corporales or incorporales (G. ii. 12, Inst.
ii. 2. pr.); thirdly (though this classification is rather matter of inference
than of direct statement), they are either res singulae or universitates
(G. ii. 97, Inst. ii. 9. 6).

The main point wherein Justinian differs from Gaius is his further
treatment of the res in patrimonio and extra patrimonium. This dis-
tinction Gaius hardly seems to consider of much importance, sor, aster
stating it, he proceeds: ‘Summa itaque rerum divisio in duos articulos
deducitur, nam aliae sunt divini iuriS, aliae humani3' res divini iuris, as
he goes on to remark, comprising res sacrae, religiosae, and sanctae ς
res humani iuris being either publicae or privatae. Justinian‚ however,
makes it the basis of a further subdivision; he arranges the res which
are extra patrimonium in subordinate classes—res communes, res
universitatis, res publicae, and res nullius—the last corresponding
with Gaius' res divini iuris. Res in patrimoni0‚ on the other hand,
either belong, or can belong, to private individuals (res singulorum);
they seem to be identical with the res privatae of GaiuS, and (the
subject of the treatise. being Private Law) are alone important for the
purpose in hand. For the ascertainment of the meaning of the ius
(privatum) quod ad res pertinet, the classifications of res as com·
munes. sacrae, religiosae, publicae, and universitatis may be regarded
as eliminated.

15 we cast our eyes ovet the contents of the second and third
books of Gaius and Justinian, we shall find that, so far as the
