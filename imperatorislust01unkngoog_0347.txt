INTRODUCTION To BOOK III. 335

with those of stipulation and Real contract, are tersely noticed. Sale

· is considered in Title 2 33 the principles relating to the moment at

which the contract is held to be concluded, the necessity of the price
being fixed and in money, and the ⁴ periculum rei,' are clearly set
forth, together with one or two changes made in the law by Justinian
himself, and an incidental notice of a subject touched upon elsewhere
in this part of the book, the doctrine of negligence in contractual
relations. Locatio conducti0‚ or hire, is discussed upon much the
same lines in Title 24, and in Title 25 are described the chief forms
of partnership, the relations of partners inter se, and the modes in
which this contract is determined. Title 26 is upon the subject of
agency‚ the species os which are classified according to the variations
in the persons benefited by the agent’s commission; the modes in
which that commission terminates, and the recipi-ocal duties of agent
and principal, are also noticed. The question which is of so much
practical importance in modern law as to the capacity of the agent to
bind and entitle his principal is passed over in silence, but is treated at
some length in Excursus IX inf. Quasi-contractual obligations are
illustrated in Title 27 by negotiorum gestio, indebiti solutio, joint
ownership and inheritance, and the relations of guardian and ward, heir
and legatee ; and Title 29 deals with the discharge of obligations, and
more particularly os those which arise ex contractu 3 the chief modes
described are performance, accord and satisfaction, release, and substi-
tuted agreement. Assignment, of which some treatment might have
been looked sor, is discussed in the Excursus (V) on the general nature
of obligations.

The description here given of the Roman contract system—if we
may use that expression to indicate the aggregate of actionable
agreements--is somewhat misleading. It must not be supposed
that in the time of Justinian, or even of GaiuS, no agreement was
ground to support an action which was neither expressed in the form
os stipulation‚ nor belonged to one or other os the classes of Real and
Consensual contracts. There had been a considerable advance in
two directions since the time when usage had restricted the term
‘ contract' to denote the four classes os agreement enumerated in
Title 13. Between the establishment of the Empire and the age os
the last great classical jurists the principle of the Real contracts had
received a great development by the recognition os the rule, that
where one party to any bilateral agreement whatsoever had performed
what he had undertaken, he had always a remedy by action to enforce
performance by the other. This great group of so-called ‘ innominate '
