Tit. 14] DE HEREDIBUS INST I T UENDIS . 257

cim uncias, quae assis appellatione continentur. habent autem
et hae partes propria nomina ab uncia usque ad assem, ut puta
haec : sextans, quadrans, triens, quincunx, semis, septunx, bes,
dodrans, dextanS, deunx, as. non autem utique duodecim uncias
esse oportet. nam tot unciae assem efficiunt, quot testator volu·-
erit, et si unum tantum quis ex semisse verbi gratia heredem
scripserit, totus as in semisse erit: neque enim idem ex parte
testatus et ex parte intestatus decedere potest, nisi sit mileS,
cuius sola voluntas in testando spectatur. et e contrario potest
quis in quantascumque voluerit plurimas uncias suam here-

ditatem dividere. Si plures instituantur, ita demum partium 6

distributio necessaria est, si nolit testator eos ex aequis parti-
bus heredes esse: satis enim constat nullis partibus nomi—

§ 5. The rules stated in this and the three following sections for the
division of an inheritance among two or more instituti may be sum·-
marised thus :—

(1) The hereditas is conceived as an as of twelve ounces, in fractions
of which the heirs respectively are instituted or take: thus A may be
instituted ex quincunce (ᾖ), and B ex septunce (ἡ).

(2) If the testator specifies no shares‚ the coheirs take ex aequis par-
tibus, ξ 6, unless it is clear that he intended otherwise: e. g. ‘ Titius
heres esto: Seius et Maevius heredes sunto: verum est quod Proculo
placet, duos semisses esse, quorum alter coniunctim duobus datur’
Dig. 28. 5. 59. 2.

(3) If he specifies the shares os one or some only, those to whom no
shares are specifically assigned take in equal proportions the difference
between the sum of the shares assigned and the aggregate of fl (e. g. A
heres ex sextante (ᾖ), Β heres ex quincunce (firm C, the heir to whom
no share is assigned, takes ex quincunce as well). If, however, the sum
of the shares assigned exceeds ss, then the heirs whose shares are not
specified take the difference between it and ξῇ, and, if this is emec-ded, ff
and so on, ἕξ 6 and 8.

(4) If he specifies shares for each and all of the heirs, which, however,
do not together make up the number 12 or any multiple of 12, their
shares are rateably increased until 12 or its next multiple is reached:
conversely, if he gives away more than the as in fractions among all the
heirs, their shares are rateably diminished‚ § 7.

It should be observed in addition that if it is clear that the testator’s
intention, in giving the instituted heirs less than the whole aS, was to
limit them, and if it is certain to whom he meant the residue to ge, they
or one of them can be compelled to convey it to him as a fideicom-
missum3 and where a testator institutes one of two heirs ex asse, and
the other in a fraction‚ the will is to be interpreted, as a mle, as if no
definite share had been assigned to the first at all, Cod. 6. 32.¹ ζῇ. pr. -
