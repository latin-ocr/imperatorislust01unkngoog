336 INTROD UCTION To BOOK III.

contracte is treated in a note on Title 1 4. 4. New contracta, though
not so called, which in effect were consensual, were called into ex· .
istence at different times by the Edict and imperial aetion ς hypotheca
(pp. 318-320 supr.), constitutum (note on iii. ao. 8), and receptum nau-
tarum, etc. (note on iv. 5. 3) are examples of the former 3 emphyteusis
(pp. 313-315 supr.) and donatio (ii. 7) of the latter. And lastly, though
this matter is disputed (Excursus V), it may be true that from the
theory of ‘ natural' obligation every agreement whatsoever came to
receive all the. legal attributes possessed by even the oldest of the
Roman contractS, except that of exposing the promisor to an action
for the enforcement of his promise.
