298 JNSTJTQTJONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [ub. 11.

3 Cum autem ratio legis Falcidiae ponitur, ante deducitur aes
alienum, item funeris impensa et pretia servorum manu-
missorum, tunc deinde in reliquo ita ratio habetur, ut ex eo
quarta pars apud heredes remaneat, tres vero partes inter
legatarios distribuantur, pro rata scilicet portione eiuS, quod
cuique eorum legatum fuerit. itaque si fingamus quadrin-
gentos aureos legatos esse et patrimonii quantitatem, ex ⁸
qua legata ¹'erogari oportet, quadringentorum esse, quarta
pars singulis ,legatariis detrahi debet. quodsi trecentos
quinquaginta legatos fingamus, octava debet detrahi. quodsi
quingentos legaverit, initio quinta, deinde quarta detrahi
debet: ante enim detrahendum est, quod extra bonor-um
‘infimitatem est, deinde quod ex bonis apud heredem re-
manere oportet.

debitorum facta peiora nomina . . . heredi pereunt ' Dig. ib. 56. pr. In
the ‚opposite case the rule was inconsistent ε if bankrupt debtors subse-
quently acquired property, the legatees were so much the better off, Dig.
ih. 56. 1. , . .

The heir was entitled to his fourth as heir: whatever else he got from
the testator, by legacy, fideicommissum, or donatio mortis causa, was not
included in it, unless the testator directed otherwise, Dig. ib. 56. 5.

ξ 8. Besides deth, funeral expenseS, and the value of slaves whom the
testator had manumitted either directly or hy fideicommissum, there

· were deducted the costs of administration, Dig. 32. 5. 72. The heir could
notclaim his legitima pars (Tit. 18 supr.) in addition to the Falcidian
fourth: the Canon law altered this where he was charged with a fidei·
commissaria hereditas (for which see next Title). The legitima pars of
those relations of the testator who could claim it was treated as a debt
due from theinheritance.

The cases in which the heir could not claim the F alcidian fourth are
briefly as follow. (1) Where the testament was that of a soldier exe·
cuted inaccordance with the rules laid down in Tit. 11 supr., Cod.·6.-21.
12. (2) Where the testator explicitly denied the fourth to the heir, which
Justinian enabled him to do in all cases by Nov. 1. 2. 2. (3) Where the
heir renounced the right, such renunciation being presumed if he paid
the legacies in full, Cod. 6. 5ο. 19: but no such renunciation bound the
heir if made during the testator’s lifetime, Dig. 32. 5. 15. 1. (4) Where
the heir forfeited his right, as he did (a) by neglecting to make an inven-
tory (p. 277 supr.), Cod. 6. 30. 22. 4, (b) hy any attempt to defi-aud the
legatees, Dig. 32. 5. 59. pn: and (c) by accepting the inheritance only
under compulsion from the legatees or fideicommissarii, Dig. 36. 1. 4:
ib. 14. 4. (5) The right to deduct the fourth did not exist in respect of
certain kinds of legacies, e. g. those of liberty to slaves, Dig. 32. 5. 33,
