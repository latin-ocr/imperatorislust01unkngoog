T HE CODE AND DIGEST OF JUSTINIAN. 6 5

commoditas exigebat ⁹). The separate laws were to be arranged in
chronological order under generic tides, and each, so far as was pos·
sible‚ identified by date and the name of the prince to whom it owed
its introduction. The work was completed in April mn. 529, and was
published under the name codex Iustinianeus with force of law from
the r6th of that month. The older codices and constitutions were at
the same time deprived of all validity, and it was even forbidden to
appeal to any leges cited in the J'uristic writings, if they had been in-
corporated, even in a modified form, in the new code.
The task of dealing in a similar manner with the writings of the
jurists was not commenced till the end of the year mn. 530, but the in-
tervening months had been employed in a preparatory labour which
Ι could not be dispensed with, and the purpose of which was a rough
' settlement of the points in controversy between the prudentes. This

had been done by a series of fifty constitutions, known as the quin-
* quaginta decisiones, which were regarded as a separate compilation:

‘ Postea vero, quum vetus ius considerandum recepimus, tam quinqua-
) ginta decisiones fecimus, quam alias ad commodum propositi operis
pertinentes plurimas constitutiones promulgavimus, quibus maximus
antiquarum rerum articulus emendatus et coartatus est? Subject to
these, the commission appointed to execute the work, which consisted
(besides Tribonian, who superintended it throughout) of sixteen per-
sons, possessed the same powers of omission, alteration, and modifi-
oetion as had been exercised by the compilers of the Code. They were
instructed not to limit themselves to the five leading jurists who
occupy so prominent a position in the ‘law of Citations,' but to select
whatever was valuable in the works of all the ‘ iuris auctores.' The
only exception to this was their admission of Arcadius Charisius and
Hermogenian, both of whom lived after Modestinus, and accordingly
had not possessed the ius respondendi. The total number of jurists
upon whom they drew for their materials was thirty-nine. Justinian
had directed that the commission shougl. arrange the result of their
labours in fifty books, which were divided into seven parts in an order
based partly on that of the code, partly on the system of the edictal
commentaries. The first part, called πρῶτα, comprised the first four
books ; the second (de iudiciis) the next seven3 the third (de rebus
sc. creditis) books twelve to nineteen3 the fourth (umbilicus) books
twenty to twenty-seven; the fifth (de testamentis) books twenty-eight
to thirty-sin the sixth and seventh, the contenta of which were very
miscellaneous, contained respectively books thirty-seven to forty-four,
and forty-five to fisty. Each book again was divided into Titles, headed
