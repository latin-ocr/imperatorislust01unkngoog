(4) the debtor is entitled to any surplus from the proceeds of the sale
after satisfaction of the debt. If no one could be found to purchase
at a reasonable price, the pledgee could in Justinian's time (by a lrind
of reintroduction of the lex commissoria, Cod. 8. 34) petition the
Emperor to adjudge him the property in full ownership: but even
such adjudication was not final, the debtor being still entitled to
redeem within two years from its date.
