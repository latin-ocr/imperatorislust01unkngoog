12 Ferae igitur bestiae et volucres et pisceS, id est omnia
animalia, quae in terra mari caelo nascuntur, simulatque ab
aliquo capta fuerint, iure gentium statim illius esse incipiunt:
quod enirn ante nullius est, id naturali ratione occupanti con-
ceditur. nec interest, feras bestias et volucres utrum in suo
fundo quisque capiat, an in alieno ε plane qui in alienum fun-
dum ingreditur venandi aut aucupandi gratIa, potest a domin0,
si is providerit, prohiberi ne ingrediatur. quidquid autem
eorum ceperiS, eo usque tuum esse intellegitur, donec tua cus·

turalem libertatem se receperit, tuum esse desinit et rursus

Bk. iv. 6. 4 inf.) no less than against the rest of the world, the transferee,
as bona fide possessor, has the actio Publiciana sor the recovery of the
property if taken out of his hands· Other cases of ‘bonitarian’ owner-
ship, though less common than this, sprang up from the praetorian legal
innovationS‚ e. g. those of praetorian universal succession in bankruptcy
and upon death : in these the proper remedy was some other fictitious
action (Gaius iv. 35).

In the time of Gaius this distinction between dominium ex iure Quiri-
tium and in bonis habere is of every-day occurrence, but, except in
respect of manumission (note on Bk. i. 5. 1 supr.), the differences between
them are not of any practical importance. When Justinian had abolished
the old points of difference between solum Italicum and solum pro-
vinciale (Tit. 6 pr. inf„ Cod. 7. 31 ; 5. 13. 15), and peregrini had practi-
cally become unknown, all these refinements disappeared: there was
but one dominium left; the only contrast was between it and possessio.
The survival of the actio Publiciana in the Corpus iuris is explained by
Mr. Poste, Gaius p. 188.

Some of the modes in which ownership is acquired in res singulae are
common to most systems of law: others are peculiar to this people or
that. The former the Romans supposed to have been prescribed or
sanctioned by the law of nature, and therefore to be prior in time
(vetustius ius) to those which are peculiar: for a peculiar mode of ac·
quisition exists only in virtue of municipal law or eustom‚ which is itself
the outcome of political society, and politica! association was preceded
in their view (derived from the Stoics, p. 36 supr.) by ages in which
nature's was the only law, and civitate5‚ magistratus, and leges had not
yet come into existence. It is hardly necessary to observe that this
view is quite erroneous: the history of Roman law alone might con·
vince us that among primitive peoples absolute private ownership is a
thing at first unknown, and that when it has been developed, alienation
is the exception, not the rule, and the modes in which it is effected
formal and essentially ‘iuris civilis)
