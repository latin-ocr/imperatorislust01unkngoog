INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV.

Tmz first five Titles of this Book relate to the two classes of Obliga-
tions which have not yet been treated, namely, those which arise from
Delict and Quasi-delict. These, we are told, are all of one character:
that is to say, the existence of the obligation does not depend in diffe-
rent cases on different ‘causae,' in the sense in which, for instance,
Sale is binding so soon as the parties have agreed upon the price,
while Exchange produces no vinculum iuris until there has been per-
formance on one side3 but their ‘ causa’ is always the same, viz. a
wrongful act (res), upon the commission of which the obligation at
once starts into existence. Of such wrongful acts four have specific
names, and are called Delicts : Thest (furtum), Robbery (rapina), Injury
to property (damnum), and wilful Injury to the person or reputation
(iniuria).

The precise differentia of Delict, as compared with other forms of
legal wrong, and the reason why some of these offences—notably Theft
and Robbery—were ever treated by the Romans as civil wrongs at all,
are topics upon which something is said in the commentary below.
The text of the first Title deals with Theft. The definition of this, as
the deliberately wrongful dealing with (moveable) property, is con-
trasted with our own English treatment of the offence by its width and
generality. Itis Thest not merely to appropriate what one knows to
belong to another, but to barely use a thin‘g of which one has under-
taken the custody or which one holds in pledge, to turn what has been
lent one to a use which it is not believed the lender would have sanc-
tioned‚ or even to deprive another of the possession of an object which
one has delivered to him as security for money owed.

The Romans divide the offence into two orderS, according as the
delinquent is or is not detected in its commission 3 the penalty in the
first case being a mulct os four times, in the second one of twice the
value of the property stolen: besides this, the offender or his heirs can
be compelled by an independent action to restore the property itself
or its value. Certain obsolete varieties of Theft, punished under the
older law by penalties quantitatively differing from these, are incident-
ally noticed3 the liability os instigators and accessories is accurately
