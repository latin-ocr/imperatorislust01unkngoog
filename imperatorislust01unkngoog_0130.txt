system of Justinian, could no longer be effected without the assent of
the child transferred to the adoptive parentage’ (Maine, Ancient Law p.
138). By a constitution of Marcus Aurelius the pater was forbidden to
divorce a son or daughter in his power without the latter's consent.

- Accordingly, Ulpian says in Dig. 43. 30. 1. 5 ‘si quis filiam suam, quae
mihi nupta sit, velit abducere, vel exhiberi sibi desideret, an adversus
edictum exceptio danda sit, si forte pater concordans matrimonium, forte
et liberis subnixum velit dissolvere? Et certo iure utimur, ne bene con-
cordantia matrimonia iure patriae potestatis turbentur.’

In the field of property, the original rule was that the filius-
familias could have no proprietary rightS, and whatever he acquired by
gift, inheritance, or otherwise, belonged to his father only. This doctrine
was not broken in upon till the Empire, when, by the institution of
peculium castrense, the son was enabled to own property acquired in
certain modes. For this, and the later history of his proprietary rightS,
see Bk. ii. 9. 1, and notes inf.

In respect of contract the filiusfamilias had always been in a dis-
serent position from a slave. A slave could be a party to a contract,
and any advantage which was to be derived belonged to the master
(Bk. iii. 17 inf.); but if he attempted to bind himself by a promise the
resulting obligation was ‘ naturalis ² only, and neither he nor his master
could be sued upon it: ‘melior conditio nostra per servos fieri potest,
deterior non potest ' Dig. 50. 17. 133. Some alteration, however, was made
in this latter point by the introduction of the actiones adiectitiae quali-
tatis, Bk. iv. 7 inf. But the promise of a filiusfamilias had always given
rise to civilis obligatio : ‘ filiusfamilias ex omnibus causis tanquam pater-
familias obligatur, et ob id agi curn eo tanquam cum patrefamilias
potest ³ Dig. 44. 7. 39. ThuS‚ on the son's contractS, the pater took all
the gains, while for the debts the son was liable to be sued, the pater not.
But it is not to be supposed that people would be over ready to contract
with a person who had no means wherewithal to satisfy the judgment in
case he was condemned3 hence we may say generally that, in Roman
law, though the capacity to validly bind oneself by contract does not go
hand in hand with proprietary capacity, yet the practical exercise of that
capacity probably did: and accordingly it was not until the filius-
familias had acquired proprietary rights through the development of the
doctrine of peculium, and the introduction of the actiones adiectitiae
qualitatis had to some extent rendered a pater liable on his son's en-
gagements, that the latter’s contractual capacity was often called into
exercise.

As the filiusfamilias had no rights of property, so he could have no
rights of action in respect thereos, and therefore could not, as a rule, sue
in his own name in a court of justice. To this there were a few excep·
tions: ‘ filiusfamilias suo nomine nullam actionem habet nisi iniuriarum,
