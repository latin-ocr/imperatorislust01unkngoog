EARLIER HIS T OR Υ· OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 625

dated money claims, and to have been extended ten years later by
lex Calpurnia to res certae of all other kinds. He adds that the
reason of its introduction was hard to see, there being already a
satisfactory remedy in such cases, viz. the sacramentum in personam.
One possible explanation is the increase in judicial business. If the
lex Pinaria had not yet been enacted, and Keller's account of it is
· the true one, we may ascribe the introduction of condictio to a desire
to relieve the centumviri of a number of suits which could very well
be tried by a single judge3 and even if that statute were already in
existence, it perhaps only made reference of the cause to a single
iudex optional to the praetor, whereas the lex Silia absolutely required
him to send condictiones to be tried in this manner. It is not im-
probable, however, that the condictio was really designed in the
interests of creditors ‘and the money-lending class, to whom, as will
be seen, it was sar more favourable than the older procedure by
sacramentum ¹. The plaintiff having got the defendant before the
praetor by in ius vocatio, challenged him to a wager by stipulatio
(sponsio poenalis) of a sum equivalent to a third of the value in
dispute, while the defendant, by restipulatio, bargained for payment
of a similar sum by him in the event of bis failing to establish his
case. This wager did not g0, like the sacramentum, to the state,
but to the party victorious in the action. Then followed the ‘ con-
dictio ’ proper ⁹, viz. notice by the plaintifl' to the defendant to re·
appear after an interval of thirty days for the appointment of a iudex
to try the case, the Subsequent procedure being much the same as in
sacramentum. It does not seem that the sponsio and restipulatio,
by which the wager ‘tertiae partis ’ was entered into, ever formed part
of the condictio to recover ‘ certa res,' which was called condictio
triticaria.

The defects of the l'egis actio procedure in general lie upon the
surface. Gaius (iv. 30) refers only to its ‘ nimia subtilitas ’ or ex-
cessive formalism. Things came, he says, to such a pass, that he
who committed the smallest error failed altogether. Sir H. Maine ³
cites a passage of Blackstone in which precisely the same remark is
made of the English law of Distress, and which is curious, as he says,
because the later of the two writers could not possibly have read the
earlier. It was not so much the ‘ nimia subtilitas ’ as the lack of safe-
