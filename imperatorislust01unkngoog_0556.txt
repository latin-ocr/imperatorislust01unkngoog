Dig. 16. 2. r. The full application os the principle was only os slew
development in Roman law. Gaius tells us (iv. 64) that bankers in suing
¹their debtors were compelled to make allowance sor what they themselves
owed the latter, and to bring their action only for the balance ; and that
the actions of bonorum emptores (p. 375 supr.) against debtors of the
purchased bankrupt estate were governed by the same mle, though the
‘deductio' in the latter case had a wider operation than the ‘compen-
satio' in the former (ib. 65—68). In bonae fidei iudicia the judge was
bound, as acting ex fide bona, to take account of sets-off arising ex
eadem causa, from the same transaction (ib. 61) ; and though justinian
says here that set-off was not allowed in stricti iuris actions tiu the
rescript of M. Aureliu8‚ and then only on the condition of the defendant's
getting an exceptio doli inserted in the formula, it would seem that this
had been done before in some actions of this class by special favour (Dig.
16. 2. 4 and 5), and that the emperor's enactment only made the matter
a general rule. Apparently too from this time onward claims arising ex
dispari causa could be set off in actions of either kind by the employment
of the same exceptio doli. The distinction between compensatio
effected officio iudicis, and that resulting from the use of the exceptio
seems (though the point is much disputed) to have lasted on in the new
process after the disappearance of the formula, until it was abolished by
Justinian's enactment here referred to (Cod. 4. 31. 14. pr. and 1), so that
in his time set—off of any kind, whether arising ex eadem or ex dispari
causa, could be advanced with effect at any stage of the action up to
judgment, and consequently the words ‘ex eadem causa’ in ξ 34 ins. are
held to have been imported into the Institutes from Gaius iv. 61 by an
oversight. Whether by this enactment justinian first allowed compensatio
in real actions (‘ sive in rem sive in personam ⁹) is also uncertain ; tracesof
its earlier application in such cases are found by some writers in Dig. 5.
2. 21. 23 5. 3. 31. 23 6. 1. 48.

1t was essential that the claims set off against one another should
relate to par materia or genus. ‘in compensationem hoc solum vocatur,
quod eiusdem generis et naturae est, veluti pecunia cum pecunia com-
pensatur, triticum cum tritic0‚ vinum cum vino’ Gaius iv. 66,‘ . si
constat, pecuniam invicem deberi’ Cod. 4 31. 43 but it is hardly certain
how far it was required that the set-off should be liquidated,' 1.e. clearly
proved or proveable. The chief authority on this point is Cod. 4. 31. 14.
