EARLIER HIS T ORY OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 635

formula was called arbitraria, because, is the plaintiff established his
right against the defendant, the latter had the option of performing
the specific act, or in default of being condemned in damages: if he
did the former, he was entitled to absolution. Though no defendant
could be compelled by this form of action to deliver specific property,
or to perform his contracts, yet it was the nearest approach to a
specific enforcement made by the formulary system. The mode,
however, in which the damages were assessed was specially adapted
to induce a defendant to perform the act demanded in preference to
paying damages; for the plaintiff was allowed to depose on oath
(iusiurandum in litem) as to the value to him of the object claimed,
or the pecuniary loss which he would suffer through the other's
breach of contract. The tendency seems to have been to favour
plaintiffS, and to accept their estimate without qualification, unless it
was outrageously unfair, so that the system may be conjectured to
have worked with tolerable success.

So far we have been concerned entirely with actions in personam.
Excluding the old procedure by sacramentum before the centumviral
court, there were two forms of real action, known respectively as
formula petitoria and the action per sponsionem. The first was the
great type of actio arbitraria, the Intentio 'running ‘ si paret eam rem
Titii esse ex iure Quiritium neque eam rem Gaius arbitratu tuo
restituet [quanti ea res erit tanti Gaium Titio condemna,' etc.]. Here
the disputed right was 'tried directly and in the open light, instead, as
in sacramentum and sponsi0, of being hidden behind a wager 3 and
the proceedings in iudicio, if the plaintiff succeeded in proving his
case, consisted of a pronunciatio by the iudex in his favour, and an
arbitratus (ut reus rem restituat) based thereon: if the defendant
refused or was unable to make restitution‚ there followed a iura-
mentum in litem and condemnatio ¹. The action per sponsionem
was closely modelled after the old sacramentum, the existence os the
right in rem which was at issue being tried as incidental to a right

formula (in ius concepta) of the actio depositi in Gaius iv. 47. if NR there may be
taken to mean ‘nisi restituat3’ but it may be argued with some force that the
formula of a bonae fidei action was not arbitraria, because the iudex in such a suit
had already, in virtue of his commission to decide the matter ⁰ ex fide bona,' all the
power which such a formula could give him, including that of absolving the de·
fendant if he satisfied the plaintiff before judgment.

¹ This was the form of action employed in hereditatis petitio, in praetorian real
actions (e.g. Publiciana), in suits relating to servitudes (confessoria and negatoria),
and perhaps in the aetio finium regundorum. It differed from the procedure per
sponsionem in the form of satisdatio entered into by the defendant, Gaius iv. 91.
