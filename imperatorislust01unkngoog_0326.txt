314 EXCURSUS II:

vectigales vocantur, qui in perpetuum locantur, id est hac lege, ut
quamdiu pro his vectigal pendatur, tamdiu neque ipsis, qui conduxerint,
neque his, qui in locum eorum successerunt, auferri eos liceat. Qui
in perpetuum fruendum conduxerunt a municipibus, quamvis non
efficiantur domini, tamen placuit competere eis in rem actionem
adversus ipsos municipeS, ita tamen, si vectigal solvant ' Dig. 6. 3.
ι and 2. A new ius in re aliena had thus arisen, heritable and alien·
able both inter vivos and by will, though not yet known by a specific
name, nor yet perhaps clothed with a very specific character. We
learn from Gaius (iii. 145) that in his day it was a question whether
the interest acquired by such lessees did not so closely resemble
ownership as to make the transaction a sale rather than a eontinet of
lettlng and hiring: but the better opinion was in the negative. After
the third century, and especially in the eastern portion of the Empire,
the practice of letting agricultural land of all kinds upon these
conditions was adopted very largely by the Emperor, corporationis
generally, and even by private persons: in the imperial enaetments
after Constantine we have a new terminology, lande so let being
termed praedia emphyteuticaria, >and the rent called pensio οι· canon
more often than vectigal. The precise nature of these perpetual
leases and of the emphyteuta’s right was determined by Zeno (iii. 24·
3 infi), who enaeted that the transaction should be governed hy the
rules neither of sale nor of hire, but be a special centract by itself:
his settlement of the law passed with little or no alteration into the
Corpus iuris of Justinian.

Subject to the principle that the general rules relating to emphy-
teusis might be modified by express provision or agreement (in which
case writing was necessary, Cod. 4. 66. 1), those mles were as follow.
The emphyteuta (person invested with the right) was emitled to the
complete use of the land (Dig. 6. 3. 1. ι) and its fruits, his title to
which was separation, note on ii. 1. 35 supr., Dig. as. ι. ⁸5. 1:
he could alter its character provided he did it no permanent injury,
Nov. 7. 3; rao. 6: his right was heritable and alienabis inter vivos
and by ¹will, and he could pledge it and create servitudes available
during the continuance of his own interest. In the form of utiles
actiones he enjoyed all the remedies of a full dominus: he had civil
(though derivative) possession, which was protected by interdicte.
But he must pay all taxea and he was liable to eviction without any
claim to compensationi sor improvements if he failed in this duty for
three successive years, or if his rent was three years in arten, or
two if the dominus was a spiritual person ς and the latter was also
