enim sui heredes sunt, quia in potestate esse desierunt pa-

§9. The old civil law of intestate succession regarded agnatio relation-
ship exclusively: those only who were in the agnatic family os a deceased
person could succeed him. Thus those whom natural reason and more
refined law deem nearer relations were osten excluded by persons to

whom later they would have been preferred : sons or daughters might be ,

postponed to a distant cousin, because by being emancipated or given in
adoption they had been capite deminuti, and so ceased to be agnatic
kindred of their own father. These anomalies, as they seem to us, were
but gradually corrected. Arranging the persons who possessed rights of
intestate succession to a deceased in classes according to priority, so that
the first excludes the second, the second the third, and so on, the first class
under the old law, as we have seen, consisted of the sui. It was enlarged
by the action of the praetor, whose mode of intervention has already been
alluded to on Bk. ii. 10. 2 supr. He could not affect the hereditas, which
was altogether beyond his control ε but he could promise the bonorum
possessio to whomsoever he pleased τ and by promising it, in the, first

instance, to liberi of the deceased, he practically added persons to the ·

class of sui who by the civil law had no claim whatever. ‘ Liberi ’ are
those descendants of a deceased man who either are‚'or would be, sui,
had they not been either emancipated or given in adoption (though in
the latter case they must have been emancipated by the adoptive before
the natural father-’s decease, § 10 inf„ Gaius ii. 136, 7); thus children
have no claim to succeed their mother as liberi (Tit. 4 int), nor have a
man’s grandchildren by a daughter. The principle was analogous to
