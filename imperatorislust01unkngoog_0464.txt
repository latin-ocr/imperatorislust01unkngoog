452 INSTJTUTJONUM LIBRI QUA TTUOR. [Lib. 111.

3 Agerius: ‘ habeo acceptumque tuli! Praeterea novatione
tollitur obligatio. veluti si id, quod tu Seio debeas a Titio
dari stipulatus sit. nam interventu novae personae nova
nascitur obligatio et prima tollitur translata in posteriorem,
adeo ut interdum, licet posterior stipulatio inutilis sit, tamen
prima novationis iure tollatur. veluti si id, quod Titio tu
debebaS, a pupillo sine tutoris auctoritate stipulatus fuerit,
quo casu res amittitur: nam et prior debitor liberatur et pos-
terior obligatio nulla est. non idem iuris est, si a servo quis
stipulatus suerit: nam tunc prior proinde obligatus manet, ac
si postea a nullo stipulatus suisset. sed si eadem persona
sit, a qua postea stipuleriS‚ ita demum novatio fit, si quid in
posteriore stipulatione novi sit, forte si condicio aut dies aut
fideiussor adiciatur aut detrahatur. quod autem diximuS, si

quired, be released in this manner. This, however, was not always the
object os the Aquilian stipulation, which, it is clear, was not unfrequently
employed as a comprehensive novation‚ the duties created by which were
intended to be, not released‚ but performed, Paul. sent. rec. 1. 1. 3, Cod.
2. 4. 3, Dig. 2. 1 ς. 2 ; ib. 9. 2. In the stipulation itsels‚ as here presented
to υς, the following possible claims are compr-ised: those arising from
contracts whether stricti iuris or bonae fidei (dare, facere), whether present
or future (oportet, oportebit), and whether existing and actionable at once,
or existing but not yet actionable (praesens in diemve); those enforce-
able by real (petitio) as well as by personal action (actio), whether now
(est) or in the future (erit), and by extraordinaria cognitio (persecutio) no
less than by ordinary action at law, and whether the promisor has merely
detention (habeS, tenes) or has or has had civil possession (possideS,
possedisti). The omission of the word praestare in the form of personal
' action (dare facere oportet) shows that the author did not intend to in-
clude obligations arising ex delicto 3 and the phrase ‘ dolove malo fecisti
quominus possideas ’ refers to the dominus’ real action against a person
who had fraudulently destroyed or conveyed away a res aliena. This was
first given by the SC. Juventianum, Dig. 5. 3. 2ο. 6 ; 6. 1. 27. 3, so that
the words cannot have formed part of the original Aquilian stipulation‚
and do not even appear in the form of it given by F lorentinus in Dig. ,
46. 4. 18. 1. In the acceptilatio of Justinian’s text the words ‘ acceptum-
que tuli’ are superfluous (see § 1) and must not be taken to refer in any
way to the litera] contract or- any other system os accountS. As Mr.
Poste remarkS, the narrative form (stipulatus est, spopondit, interrogavit),
in which the transaction is expressed by Justinian, properly belongS‚ not
to the stipulation and acceptilation‚ but to the cautio in which they are
embodied or recorded. '
