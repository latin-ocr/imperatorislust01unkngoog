Tit. 13.] DE EX CEPTIONIBUS. ’ 581

quum est tamen possessorem condemnari. Item si iudicio 5
tecum actum fuerit sive in rem sive in personam, nihilo minus

actione quis conveniatur, si iuraverit, proficiat ei iusiurandum, sive in
personam sive in rem agatur.’

§ 5. Under the legis actio procedure a second action could never be
brought on the same ground : ‘ qua de re semel actum erat, de ea postea
ipso iure agi non poterat' Gaius iv. 1083 a rule which in the formulary
period was almost entirely reversed ; see note on Pendency p. 577 supr. ;
Gaius iii. 181 ; iv. 106, 107. In the latter's time a defendant in any action
(putting aside iudicia legitima in personam with an intentio in ius con-
cepta, in which the right of action was consumed ipso iure) could, after
the lis had once been contestata, protect himself against further litigation
on the same ground by exceptio rei in iudicium deductae, and after
judgment by exceptio rei iudicatae. The first of these is no longer
found under Justinian, as litis contestatio had lost its novative effect of
destroying the right of action. With the disappearance, t00, of the
distinction between iudicia legitima and those quae imperio continentur
the rule has become universal that technically there is nothing to prevent
the commencement of an action upon a ground which has been already
adjudicated upon3 the exceptio rei iudicatae remains in full operation ;
‘ obstat, quotiens inter easdem personas eadem quaestio revocatur’ Dig.
44. 2. 3 ; ib. 7. 4. Its operation now, however, is never unjust, as it must
often have been in the formulary period, when it protected a defendant
with equal force whether the ground upon which he had been absolved
was merely technical, or one of substantial justice; whether he was ·
absolved because he had already paid the money for which he was sued,
or because the plaintifl' had carelessly brought his action a day before
the money really fell due, was immaterial ; the plea of res iudicata or in
iudicium deducta was equally available. Now, however, as is remarked
by Mr. Poste (Gaius p. 579) its rules ‘are ‘more flexible than the hard
and fast doctrine of necessary novation by sententia lata,’ for now it is
allowed to prevent a second action only so far as this is irreconcileable
with the objective grounds upon which the previous suit was decided,
and, therefore, the mere fact of pleading it does not disarm the plaintiff ;
it has to be shown that the reason why the previous action was decided
against the plaintiff would operate now (e. g. A sues B for money before
it is actually due, and B is acqultted. When the money has actually
fallen due, A renews his action ; a plea by B of res iudicata will not help
him, for the ground of the previous decision, which the court will now
examine, was not that the money absolutely was not owed, but that it
was not owed then). In fact, under Justinian, ‘ suitors were merely re-
strained, in accordance with the real object of the institution, from
harassing their opponents with renewed litigation on the precise questions
that had once been adequately decided ’ Poste’s Gaius loc. cit.

More precisely, the conditions under which the exceptio rei iudicatae

is an effective defence are the two pointed out in the passage cited above
