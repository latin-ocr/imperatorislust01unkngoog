libus remissa est. nam quamvis hi neque legitimum numerum
testium adhibuerint neque aliam testamentorum sollemnitatem
observaverint, recte nihilo minus testantur, videlicet cum in
expeditionibus occupati sunt: quod merito nostra constitutio
induxit. quoquo enim modo voluntas eius suprema sive
scripta inveniatur sive sine scriptura, valet testamentum ex
voluntate eius. illis autem temporibus, per quae citra expe-
ditionum necessitatem in aliis locis vel in suis sedibus degunt,
minime ad vindicandum tale privilegium adiuvantur: sed
testari quidem et si filii familias sunt propter militiam con·
ceduntur, iure tamen communi, ea observatione et in eorum
testamentis adhibenda, quam et in testamentis paganorum
proxime exposuimus. Plane de militum testamentis divus l
Traianus Statilio Severo ita rescripsit: ‘ Id privilegium, quod

οἱ testamentary form dates from the time of Julius Caesar. A soldier’s
will (ι) is written, did not require to be witnessed at all: ἅμαρτύρους. ..

Leonis 4ο, though§ 1, ‘convocatis ad hoc hominibus,' might seem to
imply the contrary t (2) if oral‚ could not stand if the alleged heir was the
only witness, § 1. By the enactment to which he refers (Cod. 6. 21. 7)
Justinian allowed the exercise of this privilege by a soldier only while he
was in camp or barracks on actual service (this being the meaning of
'expeditio in the text), not while on furiough: and a will so executed
remained in force only one year aster his discharge, ξ 3 inf„ and even lost
all validity is the discharge was ‘ with ignominy.’

It was not merely in respect of form that soldiers' wills were privileged.
They were not bound by the rule ‘ nemo ,pro parte testatus, pro parte
intestatus decedere potest ’ Tit. 14. 5 ins„ or by the lex Falcidia and
similar enactrnents relating to fideicommissa: they need not sormally
disinherit their children, Tit. 13. 6 int, Cod. 3. 29. 8, nor were their wills
avoided by their undergoing capitis deminutio (ξ 5infi, Dig. 28. 3. 6. 6) t
they could institute as heirs persons who could not inherit from an
ordinary testator (Gaius ii. 1 10), and could dispose of the inheritance by
codicils, Dig. 29.1. 36.

The wills of certain other persons besides soldiers were privileged m
the matter of form. By an enactment of Justinian the general law might

in rural districts be overidden by local custom‚ and signature by the wit-
nesses was dispensed with if it was difficult to find seven who could write,

and even five were held enough if more could not be got, Cod. 6. 23. 31.
