THE ROMAN LITERAL CONTRACT ΛΝΒ 1Τὸ HISTORY.

Tm: true old Roman literal oona-act, or expensilatio‚ which appar-
ently began to be disused soon after the fall of the Republic‚
was concluded by the creditor's making, with the debtor's assent, an
entry in his domestic account-book or ledger (codex, tabulae) of so
much as advanced by him to the latter (expensum serre), the transac-
tion thus appearing as a loan actual or fictitious. Such a written
entry was not mere evidence of a contract binding on some other
ground—res, verba, or consensus: by itsels it laid the debtor under a
legal obligation to repay the sum in question ε ‘ in nominibus alius
expensum ferendo obligat’ Gaius iii. 137. There are at least two
passages (Cic. ad Att. 4. ep. 18, Valerius Maximus 8. a. α) which
prove that expensilatio was a mode of creating a new and original
obligation. But it seems most ordinarily to have been employed for
the purpose of novation (Bk. iii. ²9· 3), when it was called transcrip-
tio, and the entry ⁶ nomen transcripticium’ Gaius iii. 128 : and in the
form transcriptio a persona in personam <ς veluti si id quod mihi Titius
debet, tibi id expensum tulero ' Gaius loc. cit), it must among business
men have been of great value in the simplification and seulement of
outstanding accounts. The main object of transm-iptio seems to have
been the substitution of a strict civil law for a iuris gentium connact;
or, as Mr. Poste puts its, ‘ to metamorphose claims recoverable by
actions ex fide bona, e.g. locati conducti, empti venditi, which in many
points favoured the defendant, into debts recoverable by the short and
sharp remedy of the civil action of condictiO, which, when brought for
certa pecunia credita, was the more formidable to a dishonest liti-
gant, as it was accompanied by a sponsio poenaliS, whereby the van-
quished party forfeited a third of the sum in litigation, in addition, if
he was the defendant, to the original claim! T hat this was its main
use seems more than probable on a priori groundS, for it is clear that
if gol. are due to a man on a sale (eg), he will prefer to secure by
novation a remedy by which he can recover 4ol.; and the conclusion
is made absolutely certain by a consideration of the only case in which
