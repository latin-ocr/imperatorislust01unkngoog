EXCURSUS V.

THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS.

Tan term obligatio properly indicates a legal relation between two
definite personS, whereby the one (creditor, Dig. 50. 16. 1 1, and 12.
pr.) is entitled to a certain act or forbearance on the part of the
other (debitor). The contrast' between it and the relation existing
in the case of ownership‚ possession, or other legal rights, is well

· marked by Paulus in Dig. 44. 7. 3. pr. ‘ obligationum substantia non

in eo consistit, ut aliquod corpus nostrum, aut servitutem nostram
saciat, sed ut aliurn nobis obstringat ad dandum aliquid, vel faciendum,
vel praestandum,’ with which may be compared Bk. iv. 6. 1 inf.
‘ namque agit unus quisque aut cum eo, qui ei obligatus est . . . quo
casu proditae sunt actiones in personam . . . aut curn eo agit qui nullo
iure ei obligatus est, movet tamen alicui de aliqua re controversiam,
quo casu proditae actiones in rem sunt.’ No better explanation of
this contrast can be found than Austin’s exposition ‘of the difference
between rights in rem and rights in personam, the merit of which,
however, is matred by his use of the term obligation to denote the
duty corresponding to rights os the former as well as of the latter
class·

But though this is the proper and normal meaning of the term,
obligatio is sometimes used in other senseS, and more especially to
express one or other limb of the relation in contradistinction to the
other; thus, it signifies the right of the creditor only in the common
phrase adquirere obligationem (Bk. iii. 28, Dig. 45. 1. 126. 23 23. 3.
46: cs. Bk. ii. 2. 2 supr.), and the duty os the debitor only in Dig. 12.
1. 363 46. 1. 5. 21, ib. 3. 95. 3, as well as in the definition given in
Bk. iii. 13· pr. supr. Sometimes it denotes specifically the act 'or
event from which the relation arise3‚ as in Cod. 11. 47. 22, Dig. 2.
14. 1. 3, as well as in the expressions verborum obligatio, litterarum
obligatio, etc. Again, though only a person mn properly be ‘obli-
gatus,' objects which are pledged are occasionally spoken of by
analogy as subject to an obligation‚ e. g. Bk. iii. 27. 2 supr„ Dig. 20.
