sine competenti emendatione relinquere: sed cum nepotis et
pronepotis nomen commune est utrisque, qui ‘tam ex masculis
quam ex seminis descendunt, ideo eundem gradum et ordi-

eis, qui non ‘solum naturae, sed etiam veteris iuris suffragio
muniuntur, portionem nepotum et neptium vel deinceps, de
quibus supra diximus, paulo minuendam esse existimaverunt,

and Arcadius in Cod. 6. 55. 9 and Cod. Theod. 5. 1. 4 (Am. 389): they
provided that grandchildren and still remoter descendants should rank as
liberi of their maternal grandparents or paternal grandfather, etc., in lieu
of their mother, father, etc„ their portion, however, being diminished by
one third in favour of liberi admitted by the earlier law, or if there were
none, by one fourth in favour of the agnateS. This last deduction
was abolished by Justinian in Cod. 6. 55. 12, and that of the third by
Nov. 18. 4.

It may be as well to state briefly the rules of intestate succession where
the deceased was a filiusfamilias with peculium or an emancipatus, ln
respect of peculium adventitium, Tbeodosius and Valentinian enacted
that (1) bona materna should go to the pater, (2) lucra nuptialia to the
children of the deceased filiusfamilias, the pater having the usufruct for
life z in default of children to the pater, and failing him to brothers and
sisters. Leo and Anthemius postponed the pater to brothers and sisters,
even of the half blood. Justinian extended these rules relating to lucra
nuptialia to bona materna and materni generis in their integi-ky, Cod. 6.
59. 11, and later still to all peculium adventitium from whatever source
derived.

For the earlier law relating to peculium castrense see on Bk. ii. 9. pr.
supr. ln Justinian’s time brothers and sisters as well as children of the
deceased were preferred to the pater (Bk. ii. 12. pr. supr. ‘ si vero in-
testati decesserint, nullis liberis vel fratribus superstitibus, ad parentes
eorum iure communi pertinebit : ’ cf. Cod. 6. 61. 3 and 4), who took the
peculium only if there were none to precede him. The same rules
governed the succession to peculium quasi castrense.
