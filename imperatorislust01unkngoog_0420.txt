24 Stichum vocari credideris. Quod turpi ex causa promissum
est, veluti si quis homicidium vel sacrilegium se facturum
promittat, non valet.

condicionem decesserit, postea existente condicione heres eius

rule is non-essential, and does not affect the validity of the disposition,
which relates to the properties or name (Bk. ii. 20. ²9 supr„ Cod. 6. 23. 4)
of the person to whom the declaration of intention relates, or to the name
or non-essential properties of the thing, Dig. 30. 4. pr. ; 34. 5. 28,
Cod. 6. 37. 7. 1.

In contracts mistake frequently leads to one party expressing an inten-
tion which does not agree with that expressed by the other, because the
first supposes the second’s real intention to be different from that which
he has expressed: (e. g. B offers to buy A's black horse, meaning black
horse α 3 A thinks he means black horse β, and agrees to sell : he thinks
he is agreeing to B's proposal, but in fact he is agreeing to a proposal
which B has never made.) Here there is no consent, for ‘non videntur
qui errant consentire’ Dig. 50. 17. 116. 2, and an essential element of
contract is ‘duorum pluriumve in idem placitum consensus ' Dig. 2. 14. 1.
2. In such cases the contract is void only if the mistake (i.e. the absence
of consent)‚is essential in the sense already stated (nature of the relation,
Dig. 12. 1. 18: person, ib. 32: thing, 18. 1. 9. pr.: its properties‚ ib. 2).

Error in the formation of intention (or in motive) does not necessarily
avoid dispositions, Because one is induced to act by a mistake in
motive‚ the intention is none the less real; or, in other words, unessen-
tial error, as a rule, leaves the disposition valid, however strongly it may
have operated as an inducemeng Dig. 12. 1. 523 ib. 65. 2. The chief
exception to this is in testamentary dispositions (Bk. ii. 20. 31 and note
supr.): dispositions inter vivos are invalidated by such mistake only is
the latter was known to the party benefited by them, and this approxi-
mates to fraud. 1f actual fraud on the other’s part produces the mistake,
the disposition is not ipso facto void : but if sued upon the exceptio doli
can be pleaded‚ or the party deceived can claim by the actio doli to be
restored in statum quo·

ξ 24. Cf. Dig. 45. 1. 26 ‘generaliter novimus, turpes stipulationes
nullius esse momenti,’ 12. 5. 8 ‘ si ob turpem causam promiseris Titio . . .
si petat, exceptione doli mali summovere eum possis? Cod. 8. 30. 4 ‘cum
omnia, quae contra bonos mores vel in pactum vel in stipulationem de-
ducuntur, nullius momenti sint.’ Unlawful or immoral conditions were
treated in the same way as those which were impossible: they avoided
contracts: in testamentary dispositions they were taken ‘pro non scriptis,'
Dig. 28. 7. 93 ib. 14. and 16.
