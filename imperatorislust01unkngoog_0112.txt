10 imitantur. Et non ineleganter in duas species ius civile
distributum videtur. nam origo eius ab institutis duarum
civitatium, Athenarum scilicet et Lacedaemonis, fluxisse
videtur: in his enim civitatibus ita agi solitum erat, ut Lace-
daemonii quidem magis ea, quae pro legibus observarent,
memoriae mandarent, Athenienses vero ea, quae in legibus
scripta reprehendissent, custodirent.

ll Sed naturalia quidem iura, quae apud omnes gentes
peraeque servantur, divina quadam providentia constituta
semper firma atque immutabilia permanentz ea vero, quae
ipsa sibi quaeque civitas constituit, saepe mutari solent vel
tacito consensu populi vel alia postea lege lata.

if the uniformity of action is merely accidental, and not due to common
consciousness osa mle, it is unreasonable and unfit to be law.

The principle thus precedes and generates the usage3 but the older
view contains a certain truth‚ viz. that the principle first acquires practical
validity through the usage of which it is the parent, exactly as ius scriptum
acquires binding force through publication ; and to this extent one can
say with truth, that as a statute comes into existence through publication,
so customary law comes into existence through usage or custom. Savigny
also grants that in some cases the rule is actually begotten of the usage ;
in particular, where the substance of the rule is more or less immaterial,
so long as the rule is there (e. g. fixing os legal period5, forms, etc.). On
the whole subject see Holland’s jurisprudence chap. v.

theless, the Attic writers often eulogise unwritten law, e. g. Σόλωνα νόμον

ς 11. It is clearly said here that a statute may in effect be abrogated by
a contrary custom: cs. ‘legibus istis situ atque senio obliteratis ’ Gell. ii.
24, Plautus, Tritium. iv. 3. 30. 33, Livy 27. 8, and the strong expression
of Julian in Dig. 1. 3. 32. 1 ‘ Quare rectissime illud receptum est, ut leges
non solum suffragio legislatoriS, sed etiam tacito consensu omnium per
desuetudinem abrogentur! The very contrary seems to be maintained
in a passage already cited in part (Cod. 8. 53. 2) ‘Consuetudinis usus·
que non vilis auctoritas est, sed non usque adeo suo valitura momento ut
rationem vincat aut legem.’ Perhaps the simplest way out of the diffi-
culty is to suppose that the latter passage refers to a statute in which it
is expressly provided that in no ease shall it be *taken to be repealed by a
contrary custom os later development. Now if approved custom ‘legis
vicem sustinet,’ such a provision is absurd, and resembles the well-
known rule privilegia ne irroganto in assuming that a sovereign is capable
of being legally bound. The question was submitted to the Emperor
