COMITJA CENTURJATA—PLEBEIAN SECESSIONS. 9

which underlay its application to this branch os the national life was
this—that a man ought to have an influence in public affairs pro·-
portioned to the burdens which he bore in desending the state
against its external soes. This idea could not be realised in either
of the two assemblies already existing; for in the one no plebeian,
in the other no patrician, ever so much as appeared. The result
was the establishment of a third comitia, the comitia centuriata, which
was destined, sor most purposes, to evenmally throw the other two
into the shade, and to engross the discussion of public questions,
such as η war and peace, legislation on matters affecting the con-
stitution, the choice of magistrates, and the decision of all j udicial
proceedings which involved the ⁸ caput’ of a Roman citizen. In the
comitia centuriata, where each century had a single vote, the in-
fluence of the richer middle class had an irresistible preponderance.
In the order which furnished cavalry, the patrician votes were out-
numbered in the proportion of two to one by those of the plebeians;
while the eighty votes of the first of Servius' infantry classes formed
a compact political force which could lose or win the day in a con-
tested election, or on a public question upon which opinions differed.
The political, however, were not precisely identical with the military
centuries 3 the proportion between the classes was the same, but by
the addition of a proletariate suffrage the number of military com-
panies was exceeded by the number of votes in the comitia by one.

With the expulsion of the sons of Tarquinius Superbus (circ. 509
s. c.) the kingly government of Rome came to an end. The act had
been that of the patricians; but the plebeians were in suu accord with
them, and to the harmony between the leaders of the two parties was
due the introduction of the Servian constitution by the leges Valeriae,
and in particular of the comitia centuriata, with all the powers and
privileges lately enumerated. The constitutional functions of the
king were vested in two supreme magistrates of co-ordinate authority,
who were chosen from year to year, and called at first praetors‚ and
later consuls; of the first two who were elected one was the plebeian
L. Junius Brutus. It would seem too that the plebeians now gained
the entre'e to the senate—at least, henceforward two classes of senators
are distinguished—patres and conscripti. But no provision ap-
parently was made to secure an adequate senatorial representation
of the plebs, and after Brutus there is no plebeian consul sor very
many years This will make it clear at once that, though the plebs
commanded an overwhelming majority in the comitia, its political
influence in general was far less real than might be supposed. A
