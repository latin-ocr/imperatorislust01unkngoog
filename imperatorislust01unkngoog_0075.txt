enables one to infer to which os the two empires they more properly
belong.

Certain compilations of Roman law made by the Germans who
swept away the Western empire deserve a passing notice. (ι) Among
the OstrogothS, whose king Theodoric (Α n. 475-526) conquered Italy
in Aa). 493, and ruled it as representative os the emperor at Constan-
tinople, the Roman and German systems did not, as elsewhere, stand
in opposition to one another, but the Gothic invaders resigned their
own law and submitted themselves to that of Rome. The ⁸ Edictum
Theoderici ' is a collection of the most practically important rules of
Roman law arranged in statute form for the purpose of enabling the
countrymen of Theodoric to know the law under which they lived,
and is based on the imperial constitutions and the sententiae and re-
sponsa of Paulus. Among the Visigoths and BurgundianS, on the
other hand, the original subjecte of the empire retained their own
jurisprudence, to which their conquerors declined to submit themselves,
Thus (2) the codex Alaricianus (or breviarium) was a kind of Digest
of the law observed by the Roman subjects of the Visigoth king
Alaric 11 (Am. 484-507), comprising‚ besides imperial constitutionS,
very large portioris of the commentaries of Gaius, and excerpts from
the sententiae of Paulus and Papinian’s liber I responsorum. (3) A
compilation of Roman law for the Roman subjects of the Burgundian
empire was made by order of king Sigismund about 517 A.n.; it is
usually termed ‘ Papian ' (abbreviated from Papinian, because it is said
to have commenced with that J'urist’s liber 1 responsorum), and con·
tains forty-seven Titles, part of which are taken from the code of
Alaric-

Justinian, who was of Sclav descent‚ was at the age of forty-five
(A n. 527) raised by his uncle Justinus to the position of joint ruler of
the Eastern Empire. and in the same year, by the death of his partner,
he became sole emperor. In the interval of somewhat less than a
century which had elapsed since the legal resorms of Theodosius and
Valentinian, a process of divergence had been constantly going on
between the laws laid down in the code of Theodosius and the ‘law
of Citations.’ and the law as actually applied in the tribunals. This
was principally due to the small number of copies which existed of the
authorized enactments and juristic literature: ⁴ Homines etenim, qui
antea lites agebant, licet multae leges fuerant positae, tamen ex paucis
lites praeferebant, vel propter inopiam librorum, quos comparare eis
impossibile erat, vel propter ipsam inscientiam, et voluntate iudicum
magis quam legitima auctoritate lites duwebantur ’ (Justinian in Cod.
