3hereditatis et ipsum ius utendi fruendi et ipsum ius ob-
ligationis incorporale est. Eodem numero sunt iura prae-

under which, in an action asserting ownership over an object, the object
itself was brought into the foreground of the formula, whereaS, in the for-
mulae of all other actions, whether real (asserting a ius in re aliena) or
personal, the stress was laid, explicitly or implicitly, on the existence of
the pIaintiff’s right. But perhaps the true explanation of the seeming
anomaly is that given by Mr. Hunter (Roman Law p. 142), who points
out that the most striking differente between the right of dominium, and
all other rights, was that the former could be transferred only by actual
delivery of the object, which for the conveyance of the latter was un-
necessary and often impossible.

ξ 3. Α right over a definite tangible object is called a ius in re, or real
right: if th'e object be our own, it is ius in re propria: if some one's
else, ius in re aliena. The rights comprised in the complex notion of
dominium are so indefinite that no satisfactory enumeration of them
seems possible (see Holland's Jurisprudence p. 133) ; conceivably, any
one or more of these might be separated from the rest, and vested in some
other person than the dominuS, so as to become a ius in re aliena: but
practically no system of law recognises by specific names and rules more
than a limited number of such rights, Those known to Roman law are
divided into (1) those which were recognised by the old civil law, and
which are called generically Servitudes, and (2) those which were not so
recognised‚ and are denoted by specific names.

Servitudes are either praedia! (divided into rustic and urban) or per·
sonal, the latter comprising usus, ususfructuS, habitatin, and operae ser—
vorum or animalium ; the second class of iura in re aliena consists of
three distinct rightS, emphyteusiS, superficieS, and pignuS.

Properly speaking, the term servitus denotes the quasi-nonfree con-
dition of an object over which rights are enjoyed by a person other
than its owner (‘ posteaquam ius suum deminuit, alterius auxit, hoc est,
posteaquam servitutem aedibus suis impo'suit’ Dig. 39. 1. 5. 9); but
more commonly it is used to express the deducted right itself. So
understood, it may be defined as a real right, vested in or annexed to a
definite person or piece of land, over some object belonging to another,
and limiting the enjoyment of that object by that other in a definite
manner. The following general points deserve notice 2-

(1) Servitudes may be either positive or negative, the former being
said to consist in patiendo (i. e. the dominus has to allow the other party
to do something which otherwise he could legally hinder him from, such
as walking across his field), the latter in non faciendo (the dominus
being obliged to refrain from doing some act which otherwise he would
be at perfect liberty to do, e. g. servitus altius non tollendi, inf.). But no
servitude can consist in faciendo ; in other wordS, the obligation of the
dominus cannot be to perform some positive duty, for this would give
rise to a right in personam only, whereas a servitude is a right in rem,
