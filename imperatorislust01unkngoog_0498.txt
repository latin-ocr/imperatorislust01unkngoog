the agent had made on his behalf. How far this was altered by the
praetor when the agent was his slave or filiusfamilias is explained
more fully in Bk. iv. Tit. 7 inf. But where a shipowner (exercitor)
appointed any one, whether in his power or not, as captain (magister)
of his ship, the praetor made him directly liable in full, by actio exer-
citoria, upon all business contracts made by the magister as his agent,
e. g. insurances, loans for repair8‚ ete„ Bk. iv. 7. 2 inf. The same
rule was applied by the praetor when one appointed another,
whether in one’s power or not, as one's institor, i. e. to manage a
trade or business for one, e. g. as merchant, tailor‚ banker, etc.; the
principa] was made directly liable‚ by actio institoria, on all contracts
entered into by the institor in the ordinary course of the business,
And eventually‚ if the contraet which the agent made for the principal
did not sall within the scope of either of these two remedies, the latter
was made directly liable in every case by the action called quasi-
institoria or institoria utilis, neither of which names, however, are
classical. Finally, if the agent exceeded his commission, and the
principal was benefited by the unauthorized contract, he was directly
suable pro tanto by the praetorian action de in rem verse, Dig. 4. 3.
15 pr; 19. 1. 13. 73 26. 9. 3. All four actions belong to the class
known as actiones adiectitiae qualitatis, because they were subsidiary
or additional to the natural remedy against the true contracting party;
'for though by these changes the principal had been made directly
liable‚ the agent had not therefore been exonerated3 the third party,
who contracted with him, had the option of suing whichever he
pleased, the agent by direct action on the contract, or the principal
by actio adiectitiae qualitatis, these two being in fact correi debendi;
‘ est autem nobis electi0, utrum exercitorem an magistrum convenire
velimus’ Dig. 14. 1. 1. 17, ‘item si servus meus navem exercebit, et
cum magistro eius contraxere, nihil obstabit quominus adversus ma-
gistrum experiar actione, quae mihi vel iure civili vel honorario com-
petit: nam et cuivis alii non obstat hoc edictum, quominus cum
magistro agere possit: hoc enim edicto non transfertur actio sed
adicitur' Dig. ib. 5. 1: and it does not seem to be true, as some
maintain, that the agent's liability ceases as soon as he is no longer
agent, or is limited by the extent of the principal's assets.
