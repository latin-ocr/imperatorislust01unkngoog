IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES. 317

tection, a new form of real security, called pignus, came into exist-
ence, the transaction consisting in mere delivery (traditio) of pos-
session of the object (as distinct from its ownership) from debtor to
creditor, with the understanding that the possession should be re·
delivered on payment of the debt: ‘ pignus est, quod propter rem
creditam obligatur, cuiusque rei possessionem solum ad tempus con· -
sequitur creditor, dominium penes debitorem est’ Isidor. orig. 5. 25,
‘ proprie pignus dicimus„ quod ad creditorem transit, hypothecam, cum
non transit, nec possessiO, ad creditorem’ Dig. 13. 7. 9. 2. In origin
perhaps pignus was regarded less as a form of security than as a
device by which the debtor‚ being deprived of the possession and
enjoyment of property, would be strongly induced to make every
effort to discharge his liability as soon as possible. This conjecture
is strengthened by the fact that a right of sale was not incidental to a
pignuS, as such; is the creditor had it at all, it was only by express
agreement (Bk. ii. 8. 1 supr. from Gaius ii. 64), and to sell it without
such right was theft in law: ‘si is qui pignori rem accepit, cum de
vendendo pignore nihil convenisset, vendidit. . . . furti se obligat '
Dig. 47. a. 74. As a matter of common right, the creditor was
entitled only to retain possession os the object pledged 3 he might
not use it: ‘ si pignore creditor utatur, furti tenetur ’ Dig. ib. 54; cs.
Bk. iv. 1. 6 int: but where the object was a fruitbearing thing, it
was often agreed that the pledgee should be entitled to the fruits in
lieu of interest: the pignus was then called specifically antichresiS.
Pignus then, in itself, is not a ius in re aliena. The sole right
which the pledgee could assert against the world· was the right of
possession, and this is never treated as a ius in re aliena by the
Roman juristS. The right of sale, as has been observed, rested only
upon specific agreement: and even where it had been stipulated sor
the system had grave flaws. No object could be pledged in this
manner which could not be possessed. In relation to some other
species of property pignus was no real security at all: even if the
pledgee were in possession of a praedium Italicum, the pledgor could
mancipate it to a third person (the transaction not being required to
be on the land, Gaius i. κει), who could recover it by real action.
Lastly, if the pledgee proposed to exercise his right of sale, he could
give no better title than he had himself : all that he could transfer to
the vendee was possession. This, it is true, would in time be con-
verted by usucapio into dominium, and in the meanwhile the possessor
would be sufficiently protected by the actio Publiciana (Bk. iv. 6. 4
and notes ins.); but the inability of a pledgee to make a good title as
