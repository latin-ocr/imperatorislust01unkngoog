8 edictum iuris honorarii portio est. Responsa prudentium
sunt sententiae et opiniones eorum, quibus permissum erat
iura condere. nam antiquitus institutum erat, ut essent qui
iura publice interpretarentur, quibus a Caesare ius respon·
dendi datum est, qui iuris consulti appellabantur. quorum
omnium sententiae et opiniones eam auctoritatem tenent, ut
iudici recedere a responso eorum non liceat, ut est con·

Sstitutum. Ex non scripto ius venit, quod usus comprobavit.

(General Introduction, p. 22 supr.) The first Title of Dig. 21. is ‘de
aedilicio edict0,’ and out of his jurisdiction in such matters arose certain
actions of Roman law (‘actio redhibitoria and actio aestimatoria seu
quanti minoris,’ note on Bk. iii. 23. 3 inf. ; cf. Bk. iv. 9. ι’ inf.) imposing
an obligation of warranty on vendorS, at first in market overt, and then
in all sales. stipulationes aediliciae, analogous to the praetorian stipula·
tions mentioned in Bk. iii. 18. 2 inf„ are spoken os in Dig. 45. 1. 5. pr.

§a For the responsa prudentium see General Introd. p. 50 supr„
and for the difficulties of this particular passage, p. 51. Theophilus dis·
tinguishes between sententia and opiniones. thus : sententia . . .ἅναμφι’-
βολος ἀπόκρισις, opinio μετὰ ἕνδοιασμοῦ προσφερομένη ἀπόκρισις.

ξ 9. To the ius non scriptum belongs (besides the mores maiorum, the
national customary law of Rome) the whole of the ius gentium originally,
and subsequently such parts of it as did not become scriptum by being
worked into the edict or other legislation.

Mos is to be distinguished from consuetudo (in sofar as the latter
term has a jural meaning), for it includes ‘ positive morality’ no less than
mles strictly legal: ‘morem esse communem consensum omnium simul
habitantium, qui inveteratus consuetudinem facit ³ Servius ad Verg. Aen.
vii. 601, ‘morem-praecedere, sequi consuetudinem . . . perseverantium
consuetudinis . . . cultus moriS, quod est consuetudo ' Macrob. Saturn. It
has been stated in the General Introduction (p. 2 supr.) that originally
the Roman law existed only in the form of custom. Legislation, direct
and indirect‚ was of later introduction, but steadily tended to absorb
customary law. The Twelve Tables were in the main a statutory re-enact-
ment of the customs then recognised as binding: others were taken up
into subsequent statuta, the Edict, and the writings of the iuris auctores,
until in the time of Gaius, and still more of course in the period im·
mediately preceding Justinian, there were but few general customs pos·-
sessing legalzvalidity as such, though many statutes and quasi-statutory
rules could be traced in their origin to this source. This is the case with
acquisition by conventio in manum (Gaius iii. 82) and by adrogation (ib.
and Bk. iii. 10. pr. infi), and with substitutio pupillaris (Bk. ii. 16 pr. infi).
The validity of customary law is stated emphatically not only here and
in Bk. iv. 17. pr.‚ but also in the Digest and Code: ‘de quibus causis
scriptis legibus non utimur, id custodiri oportet, quod moribus et consue·
tudine inductum est ’ Dig. 1. 4. 32, ‘inveterata consuetudo pro lege non
immerito custoditur’ ib„ ‘ quae sunt moris et consuetudinis„ in bonae
