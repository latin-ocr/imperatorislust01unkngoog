minus plene adoptatus retained the right against his natural father. As
is remarked in the text, the action was barred if the claimant could
obtain his due alio iure, e. g. by bonorum possessio contra tabulas, is

§ 3. Before justinian the querella lay whenever the claimant had re·
ceived less from the testator than he was entitled to by law: ‘si parum,
quam ei debebatur, fuerit consecutus, movere de inofficioso testamento

Cod. 3. 28. 4. The share which one could demand was one-fourth of
what one would have had if the testator had died intestam, Dig. 5. 2. 8. 8.
justinian subsequently enacted, by N ov. 118. 1, that if a man had less
than five children he must leave them together, in equal shares, at least
a third of the inheritance3 if five or more, at least one-halt

a claimant under the will as counsel was held to exclude one from im·
peaching it on one’s own account, Dig. ib. 32. pr.
