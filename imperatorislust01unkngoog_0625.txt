EARLIER HIS T OR Y OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 613

geologist is enabled in some measure· to reconstruct the natural history
of past ages,·so·in the language of ⁹the Romans, as 'well as in ³their
law, we I'find unmistakable testimony that, among the men from
whom their race descended, and before ‘the state yet existed even in
embryo, the world, which we conceive as ruled by law, was ruled by

soree, and by personal force alone each man’s position was determined. ,
Might, if not right, is at least her mother ; there being no state “²

machinery for the protection of life and property, man has either to
suffer his own effacement,·or to keep with the strong arm that which
he has won by his labour or his blood: and theessence of early ideas
lies in the absence of any basis for right and law other than the
individual consciousness, and the consequent necessity of sels-asser-
tion: ⁶ in sich selbst tragt der Einzelne den Grund seines RechtS,
durch sich selbst rnuss er es schiitzen¹.’

· Space does not allow us to cite more than a few of the most
striking facts of law and language in support of „this statement.
Thus, the origin and true ground of dominium, or lawful control over
objects of enjoyment‚ is placed by the Romans in *the idea, not of
mere occupatiori or peaceable discovery, but os ‘taking ’ or forcible
seizure: ‘ maxime sua esse credebant‚’ says Gaius (iv. 16), ‘quae ex
hostibus cepissent; ' and ,perhaps the earliest term by which they
denoted property (mancipium) at once arrests the attention,’combin-
ing, as it doce, with the idea of ‘ taking ’ another term, manua, which,
as we shall see, is no less valuable evidence of primitive ideas ; pro·
perty is that which is taken by strength of arm ². Precisely the same
thought reappears in the early form of conveyance; the property was
deemed to pass not so much in virtue ·of the will of the ,partiea or of
delivery by the one to the other, as by the ‘ taking' of the-object by
the latter (mancipatio); original is symbolised in derivative acqui-
sition. Sir Henry Maine (Early History of Institutions p. -2 53) refers
to Mr. McLennan’s work on ·‘ Primitive Marriage,’ «to show ‘that a
large part of mankind still simulate in their marriage ceremonies the
carrying off the bride by violence, and thus preserve the memory of
the reign of force which, at all events as between tribe and tribe, pre-
ceded everywhere the reign of law 3 ’ that this was-usual among the
early Romans might have been conjectured from the legend of the

seventy peges of the same volume for many of the thoughts expressed in the early

part of this ExcursuS.
