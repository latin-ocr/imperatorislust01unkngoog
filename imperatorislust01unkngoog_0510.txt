1 Furtum est contrectatio rei fraudulosa vel ipsius rei vel
etiam usus eius possessionisve, quod lege naturali prohibitum

in furtum, but in rapina and damnum iniuria datum both penalty and
compensation are recovered by a single action, which for that reason is
called mixta3 i.e. it is ‘tam rei quam poenae persequendae comparata ’
Tit. 6. 19 inf.

Gaius' remark (iii. 182) that all delicts are os one kind, which Justinian
here explains by saying that they all ‘ex re nascuntur‚’ means that in
them the obligation is not produced (as in contracts) by different causae3
it springs from the wrongful act itself, and from that alone. The use of
the word ‘res’ (sor which cf. the line cited from Terence p. 451 supr.) is
unhappy, because it suggests a reference, as probably Justinian intended,
to the obligations quae re contrahuntur, Bk. iii. 14 supr. ; in the Digest
the idea is better expressed by ‘factum :’ ‘ex sacto actio est, quotiens ex
eo teneri quis incipit quod ipse admisit, veluti furtum vel iniuriam com-
misit vel damnum dedit’ Dig. 44 7. 25 ; ib. 52. 8. In 52. pr. of the same
Title factum in this sense is opposed to res as a generating cause uf
obligations ex contractu.

Of the four delicts here mentioned furtum and iniuria are older than
the otherS, both being treated in the Twelve Tables, Gaius iii. 189, Tit. 4.
7 inf. Damnum iniuria datum was constituted a specific delict by the
lex Aquilia, circ. 285 13. c., and rapina or robbery by the praetor’s edict,
nc„ 77.

§L This definition requires expansion in two particulas-s· To rei
should be added mobilis (see Bk. ii. 6. 7 supr.) : and the motive must be
gain ; a point marked in the counterpart of the definition given in Dig.
47. 2. 1. 3 <lucri faciendi causa): cf. Dig. ib. 43. 43 ib. 65. Its terms
require some elucidation. Contrectatio implies that without an ‘ overt
act' there can be no furtum: cf. §6 inf„ and Dig. 47. 2. 52. 19 ‘neque
verbo neque scriptura quis furtum facit, hoc enim iure utimur, ut furtum
sine contrectatione non fiat 3' but the nature of this overt act may be
manifold, as will appear below. Fraudulosa implies unlawful intention ;
intention, because furtum ex affectu consistit, §§ 7 and 18 inf. 3 and unlawful
intention, because if the person acting honestly believes that his act will
not be objected to by the person wronged‚ it is not theft: ‘ si permis·
surum credant, extra crimen videri ³ ξ 7 inf„ though whether in cases such
as that of which Justinian is immediately speaking unlawful intention
would not be a presumption iuris et de iure is a question. The animus
lucri faciendi fails, if the wrong-doer’s intention is merely to cause a
damage to the other ; e. g. is he takes property intending immediately to
throw it into the sea, Dig. 19- 5. 14. ²3 but the requirement of its pre-
sence is satisfied if the intention is not to aggrandize onesels pecuniarily,
but to benefit onesels in some other way—e. g. where one steals a ring in
order to make a present os it: ‘ nam species lucri est ex alieno largiri et
beneficii debitorem sibi adquirere' Dig. 47. 2. 54. 1. The division into
furtum rei ipsius—usus—possessionisve is not designed to distinguish
