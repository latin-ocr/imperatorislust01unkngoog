his plea in desence. Thus the material nature of an exceptio is that
it is a plea of a countervailing right; its form is that os a negative
condition of the condemnatio, introduced by the words ‘ si non’ or
an equivalent; and its place in the formula is between the Intentio
and the CondemnatiO. A simple illustration is found in the exceptio
pacti (Gaius, iv. 116) ; e. g. Aulus owes Titius money, for which the
latter promises not to sue, and then nevertheless brings his action3
Aulus would repel him by the exceptio ‘ si inter Aulum et Titium non
convenit ne ea pecunia peteretur.’ The usual Roman classifications
of exceptiones are noticed in the text (Bk. iv. 13) and commentary; the
answer to the question, in what classes of actions this peculiar rule
had the widest operation, depends on the character of the Intentio·
The more special and definite the Intentio, the more likely was it
that the defence would consist in the allegation of a countervailing
right rather than in a direct traverse of the plaintiff’s claim. In real
actions accordingly, it was the rule that desences other than a simple
denial of the Intentio must be expressed in the formula. In personal
actions a distinction must be drawn. In condictio the same rule.
applied3 but in bonae fidei iudicia the Intentio claimed only what the
defendant owed ex fide bona, so that any defence which alleged want
of good saith on the plaintifl's part was practically a comple traverse
of the latter’s claim, and so need not be introduced into the formula
as an exceptio. This the Romans expressed in the maxim ‘ doli
exceptio bonae fidei iudiciis inest ; ’ which may perhaps be expanded
into a general rule, that in bonae fidei actions desences by way of
countervailing right need not be alleged in iure so far as they were
grounded on equity and bona fides, but only where they were based
on the ius civile, or on rules of procedure ².

Sometimes the plaintiff could meet an exceptio by an answer of
the same kind3 he did not deny its truth‚ but set up a second
countervailing right of his own-*an exceptio to an excepti0. This
was called a replicati0, and was inserted in the formula by the words
⁸ aut si,’ or an equivalent. And this kind of sparring between the
parties might lead further to a duplicatio, a triplicati0, and so on;
illustrations os which will be found in Gaius iv. 126-129.

Praescriptiones pro reo do not differ substantially from exceptiones·
In the earlier part of the formulary period many desences by way of
countervailing right were clothed in a peculiar form, being placed at

² See Keller, civil Process 5 25. In this respect actions with a formula in
facturn concepta do not seem to have been on the smne footing with those which
were bonae fidei.
