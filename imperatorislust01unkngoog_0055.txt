THE EDICTUM PERPE T UUM—-T HE PRUDENTES. 43

would doubtless have been carried on by other organs; for instance,
we know that a fresh impulse was given to the growth of the praeto-
rian law of succession by the lex Papia Poppaea in the time of
Augustus. But, as a matter offset, the two praetors at Rome, and the
governors in the provinces, continued to issue their annual edicts
under not only Augustus but also his successorS, and the ius gentium
was still, as before, being constantly worked into the legal system, and
alterations and additions being made in that large part of the urban
edict which had now been handed down from praetor to praetor for
generations. These additions and alterations, however, were in the
main occasioned by contemporaneous legislation (e. g. the leges Fal-
cidia, Iulia et Papia, and various senatus consulta); sor we may venture
to suppose that, when the comitia passed no statutes which were not
originated by the emperor, a magistrate would have hesitated to repeal
or alter, or extend the law, with the independence which had been
usual under the free Republic.

From the time os Hadrian (A. n. 117-1 38) the formal separation
which has been noticed between the respective edicts of successive
praetors ceased to· exist. That emperor divided the whole of Italy
into Rome, with its immediately sur-rounding territory, and four other
districts3 Rome and its suburbs remained under the authority of the
old magistrates, and among them of the praetor, while the other
districts were placed under the administration of a new class of
officialS, called at first consulares, and aster M. Aurelius (mn. 161-180)
iuridici. With this change was in all probability connected a still more
sweeping reform effected by Hadrian. In the year ¹31 Α. n. he issued‚
through Salvius Julianus», praetor designate, a revised edition of the
edicts of the praetores urbanus and peregrinus, arranged in a sys-
tematic form, in which also the edictum provinciale and aedilician
edict seem to a large degree to have been incorporated. This, which
was called the ‘ edictum perpetuum’ par excellence, was published
with the force of law for the whole empire‚ and the ius honorarium
from this time onward ‘legis vicem obtinuit,’ instead of depending sor
its validity on an annual re-enactment, Henceforward t00, though
the magistrates for-mally retained their ius edicendi, the old practice,
according to which each praetor issued an edictum perpetuum at the
commencement of his year oi* office, was relinquished; the J'urists
after Hadrian regard the edict of their own time as something perma-
nent and unalterable, except by the action of the emperor; and
Hadrian himself evidently directed that any defect which might sub-
sequently be discovered in the law should be supplied by imperial
