As to loss of Possession through agents, it should be observed‘,
(1) That mere intention of the principal no longer to possess is
sufficient; Detention may remain, but one of the elements of Pos-
session‚ animus, has ceased to exist. (a) On the other hand, if,
though the principal no longer has Detention, his representative has,
the Possession is not terminated: ‘ si quis me vi deiecerit, meos non
deiecerit . . . . per eos retineo possessionem' Dig. 43. 16. 1. 45: nor is
it lost even by cessation of the representative's Detention, unless De-
tention becomes physically impossible, or Possession is assumed by
some one else. (3) For the representative to convert his own De·
tention into Possession‚ there must be either traditio brevi manu
(contrarius animus on the part of the principal), or (Dig. 41. π.
3. 18) some contrectatio on the other's part amounting to furtum.
(4) Misdealing by the agent (i.e. conveyance or abandonment) does
not terminate the Possession unless another party directly assumes it.
(5) Mere termination of the relation of principal and agent does
not, in itself, extinguish the Possession‚ Dig. 41. 2. 38 3 ib. ²5· ¹3
ib. 40. 1.

A question which has been much discussed is why Possession‚ apat-t
from bona fides and title, carne to be treated as a right, and protected
by legal remedies. To this Savigny answers, that the violation of
Possession‚ being in itself no wrong, can originally have been re-
dressed only because it went hand in hand with some violation of an
actual right, and that sun justice could not have been done in the
matter os this latter violation, unless at the same time the Possession
were protected. All the possessory interdicts, he says, presuppose
some wrongful act. In cases of violent dispossession this is obvious:
· but even where there is no violence the idea is the same3 e. g. in the
application os the interdict de precario there is the wrongful act of
abusing another person's good nature: cf. Holland's Jurispmdence,
p. 130. On the historical question, in what connection the necessity
os legal protection was first felt, Savigny adopts the theory of Niebuhr,
that possessory interdicts were originally devised in order to guard
the interest of the individual citizen in the ager publicus, which the
State permitted him to occupy and enjoy, and were subsequently
extended to the Possession of private, property, moveable and im·
moveable. In support of this it is pointed out that possessio and
possidere are very uniformly used to technically denote this kind of
occupation‚ and that the interdicta recuperandae possessionis relate
only to immoveables3 other arguments are derived srom the known
facts os precarium and emphyteusis (Savigny, Possession ξ 12 ⁸). Α
