Tit.14.] QUIBUS MODISRE CONTRAHITUR OBLIGATIO. 383

dubium non est, quin de restituenda ea re tenearis. com·
modata autem res tunc proprie intellegitur, si nulla mercede
accepta vel constituta res tibi utenda data est. alioquin
mercede interveniente locatus tibi usus rei videtur: gratuitum
enim debet esse commodatum. Praeterea et is, apud quem 3
res aliqua deponitur, re obligatur et actione depositi, qui et
ipse de ea re quam accepit restituenda tenetur. sed is ex eo
solo tenetur, si quid dolo commiserit, culpae autem nomine,
id est desidiae atque neglegentiae, non tenetur: itaque securus

sonable care (diligentia, sor which see Excursus Vl at the end of this
Book) were (1) to restore the object lent at 'the time agreed upon, or so
soon as the purpose sor which it was lent was satisfied: it could be re-
demanded earlier only upon breach of another general term of the con-
tract,·viz. (2) to use it only for the purpose sor which it was lent ε to use
it sor others was thest, if the borrower was aware that the other would
not have perrnitted it, Bk. iv. 1. 6-8 inf„ (3) to return it in as good con-
dition as when received, excepting such deterioration as naturally results
from its use, or as might reasonably have been expected: ‘si reddita
quidem sit res commodata, sed deterior reddita, non videtur reddita, quae
deterior sacta redditur, nisi quod interest praestetur: proprie enim dicitur
res non reddita quae deterior redditur’ Dig. 13. 6. 3. 1 ε for the excep-
tions see ib. 23, and 5. 7, cited in Hunter’s Roman Law p. 302, (4) to
restore not only it, but also any gain which he may have made by using
it in a manner not authorized by the contract, Dig. ib. 13. 1.

Like depositum, pignuS, and mandatum, commodatum is said to be an
imperfectly bilateral contract: i. e. as a general rule, only one of the
parties (the borrower) is bound, and only one (the lender) is entitled.
But very often a liability os the latter will arise from circumstances pos-
terior to the contract itself ε thus, in commodatum, though (4) supr.
implies that all ordinary expenses in connection with the object lent must
be borne by the borrower, the lender will be bound to indemnify him for
any extraordinary costs necessarily incurred: e.g. ‘quicquid in rem com-
modatam ob morbum vel aliam rationem impensum est a domino recipi
potest' Paul. sent. rec. 2. 4. 1 ε or sor any injury caused by it to the bor-
rower or his property, if this can be attributed to the fault of the lender:
e.g. Dig. ῐ 3. 6. 22. These duties can be enforced against the lender
either by retentio (lien) or by actio commodati (contraria).

§ 8. Like commodatum, depositum was a gratuitous contract: in the
absence of special agreement, the depositary's duties were as follow: (1)
to take the same care of the res deposita as he took of his own : ‘nisi
tamen ad suum modum curam in deposito praestat, fraude non caret:
nec enim salva fide minorem his quam suis rebus diligentiam praestabit ’
Dig. 16. 3. 32, hence he was not answerable if the property was stolen,
though as a rule it was presumed that allowing theft argued absence of
diligentia exacta, Dig. 17. 2. 5²· 3: (2) to return it in as good condition
