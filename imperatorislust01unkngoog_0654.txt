sold, the debt discharged, and the surpluS, if any, returned to the
debtor. This is not unfrequently called pignoris capio (e. g. Cod.
viii. 23 ⁶ si in causa iudicati pignus captum sit '). Another change
in this department of law is found in the procedure in actiones asbi-
trariae for exhibition or restitution. The defendant was no longer
allowed to retain the object on condition of paying damages 3 the
plaintiff could demand direct execution of the judicial arbitratus manu
militari, the defendant being condemned only in a sum equivalent
to fruits and accessions consumed or wasted. We read of this first
in Ulpian, and it seems to have come into use only quite at the end
of the formulary period: how far the principle was applied to the
specific performance of contracts is uncertain.

Though the ‘ ordo iudiciorum privatorum,' or system under which
judicial proceedings wenc divided between magistrate (ius) and iudex
(iudicium) was the regular mode of trying suits for centuries aster
the abolition of Statute-ProceSS, cases not unfrequently occurred
which the praetor reserved altogether for his own cognisance‚ and
heard throughout and determined without reference to a iude13 in
these the cognitio was said to be ‘ extraordinaria,' i.e. outside the
‘ ordo' or usual procedure, At first such cases were those only in
which a iudicium proper was impossible, or at any rate would in
some degree have shocked the Roman sense of what was fit and
proper, on account either of the nature of the application, or of the
relation between the parties; e. g. complaints of slaves against their
masters, freemen against their patronS, children against their pater-
familiaS, and pupils against their guardiam, especially in respect of
maintenance, claims for sees (honoraria) irreeoverable at lant, and
fideicommissa. A petition addressed to the praetor on any of these
matters was properly called persecuti0; the other party was sum-
moned before him by one of his lictorS, and, though incidental points
(e. g. aestimationes and questions of account) were often referred to
arbitri for examination and report, he heard and determined the matter
in person. The decision was called decretum, not sententia, a dis-
tinction whose significance will be readily comprehended3 a decre-
tum depended forits effect and validity on the imperium, not the
iurisdictio, of the magistratus decernens; accordingly it was not
necessarily binding on any other magistrate who was not his political
subordinate, and therefore was in effect subject to revocation and
revision by others aswell as by himself ¹.

restitutio) see note on Bk. iv. 6. 33 supr.
