unknown to the authorities: Gaius says (i. 115 a, 162 3 iv. 38) that
a woman who passed in manum undet-went capitis deminutio, and
does not add that this occurred only when she had been sui iuris, and
there is the same silence as to the assumed distinction in Ulpian,
reg. 11. 13, and Cic. Top. 4. Savigny affirms that though in these
passages there is no express limitation to the case of independent
women, yet this limitation must be understood, in which supposition
Mr. Poste (note on Gaius i. 162) thinks there is nothing ‘ outrageous.'

(3) In reply to the question why a child, on being emancipated or
given in adoption, was capite minutus, Savigny answers ‘because a
necessary step in these processes was the assumption of the condition
of mancipium, a semiservile condition (“ cum emancipari nemo possit
nisi in imaginariam servilem causam deductus '³ Dig. 4. 5. 3), and it
was this degradation, not the emancipation or adoption itselt', which
produced the capitis deminutio! Assuming the truth of this for the
sake of argument, it follows that when sor the old forms of emancipa-
tion and adoption Justinian substituted new forms (notes on Bk. i.
Tit. 1 1. 2, Tit. 12. 6 supr.) in which there was no approach to ‘ degra-
dation,’ emancipation and adoption must have ceased to be attended
by capitis deminutio. But the passages in the Corpus iuris which
affirm that capitis deminutio still accompanied emancipation (e.g. Bk. i.
16. 3. supr. ⁴ vel contra : ' Dig. 4. 5. 3 ib. 9 etc.), are too numerous to
allow us to believe, as Savigny supposeS, that they were admitted into
the Corpus by an oversight of the compilers : and as adoptio plena
extinguished patria potestas», we may almost certainly conclude that
this extinction was still attended by change os agnatic family, which
(except in one or two anomalous cases) always went hand in hand
with any extinction of patria potestas which was produced by act of

· the partieS.

There are certain legal facts upon which Savigny relies as abso·
lutely irreconcileable with the view adopted in the notes referred to,
and which are supplied by the cases ot' the Vestal Virgin and the
Flamen Dialis, As regards the former Gellius says (1. a) ‘ virgo
autem Vestalis simul est capta atque in atrium Vestae deducta et ponti-
ficibus tradita, eo statim tempore sine emancipatione ac sine capitis
minutione e patris potestate exit et ius testamenti faciendi adipiscitur
. . . . virgo Vestalis neque heres est cuiquam intestato neque intestatae
quisquam, sed bona eius in publicum redigi aiunt. Id quo iure fiat,
quaeritur! From this passage Savigny infers that —- though, as is
expressly stated, she had not been capite minuta—a Vestal Virgin left
her previous agnatic family. It is to be observed that this is merely
