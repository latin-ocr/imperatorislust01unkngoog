 

ROMAN LITERAL CONTRACT AND ITS HISTORY. 479

a iuris gentium contract was not ‘ novated ' by entry in the codex.

“ Gaius tells us (iii. 131) that the entry of a genuine money loan lest the

uansaction a mutuum or real contract, though known by the specific
name of nomen arcarium. The explanation of this seeming anomaly
is that the remedy on mutuum alone of all the real and consensual
contracta was always condictio: and as consequently novation of a
mutuum by transcriptio could give the creditor no advantage which he
did not possess already, its entry in the ledger did not alter the ‘musa'
of the obligation, but served only as evidence, Gaius loc. cit.
Expensilatio, as has just been remarked, was a formal civil law
contract, confined to Roman citizens, though the Sabinians had held
that for transcriptio a re in personam at least might be used also by
peregrini. We leam, however, from Gaius that the latter had a form
of literal contract of Greek origin peculiar to themselveS, viz. the chi-
rographa and syngraphae, species of bonds of which the former were
signed by the debtor only, while the latter were executed in duplicate,
and signed by both parties. It seems clear, from the passage referred

to (iii. 1 34), that, unless made merely as evidence of a stipulation, .

these had binding force for peregrini in themselves, though they would
not have bound citizens: or, as Savigny ‘says (verm. Schriften i. p.
246), it was law in the provinces, as contrasted with Rome, that any
formless document attesting an agreement was actionable.

Asconius, the early commentator on Cicero, observes (in Verr. 2. r.
23) that in his time the codex, and with it expensilatiO, had gone out
of use except among bankers (argentarii), wh0, as might have been
expected, continued longer to keep their books in the old Roman
fashion, though Justinian says in Bk. iii. 21, that in his own day such
entries, even supposing them to have still been made, had ceased to
create obligations. Whether it be true or not, as Asconius (confirmed
by Eusebius) says himself, that he wrote about the middle of the first
century of our era, the commentary on the Verrine orations is of so dif-
ferent a character from the rest that Savigny and Niebuhr may be right
in ascribing it to a rldacteur of the fourth century, in which case the
fact that Gaius describes literal contr-act as apparently in fun operation
need create no difficulty. PerhapS, indeed, as was first suggested by
Schuler, the disappearance of nomina transcripticia is to be ascribed to
the introduction of constitutum, which, instead of novating the pre·
existing obligation, added to ita fresh one upon which the creditor, if
successful, would recover an even heavier penal sum than he would by
condictio certi (p. 415 supr.), and which was superior to them in its
simplicity and formlessness.
