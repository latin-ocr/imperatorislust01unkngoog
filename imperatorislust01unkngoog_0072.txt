60 INTRODUCTION.

rized jurists at the time os their appointment had been the five whose
names have been mentioned. And the force of this fact is irresistibly
increased by the words used by Justinian in Cod. r. 17. 2. 20 with
reference to the publication of the Digest, where he says that he has
’ therein made selections from the jurists (legislatores et commentatores)
‘ quos et anteriores piissimi principes admittere non sunt indignati!

It would seem then that the true meaning of the disputed passage
is that which has been given to it by other civilians¹; namely‚ that
it was intended to supply a criterion by which the authority os any
and every juristic writer could be tested. Its intention was not to
exclude any authorized jurist, but to remove the difficulty which arose
from the existence and quotation of works by writers who had re·-
ceived no auctoritas or ius respondendi, and to which Justinian bears
witness in Cod. 1. 17. 1. 4. The test was to be the ius respondendi,
and the possession of this was to be inferred from the fact of one
jurist being cited as an authority by another of undeniable reputation.
The legislator attained his object by selecting a small number of the
most recent and distinguished jurists who had possessed the ius re-
spondendi, and by confirming their authority, and also that of all
others whose views they quoted. Some difficulty is occasioned by
the words ‘ si tamen eorum libri propter antiquitatis incertum codicum
collatione,' which seem to mean that even when a Jurist is cited by
one of the five, he is not to be allowed a voice in the decision of a
case unless his view, as quoted, is proved and confirmed by a com-
parison of the passage of the citing jurist with the original work
(codices) of the author quoted. The enactment would thus prac-
tically secure to all approved writers the weight which they had
hitherto enjoyed, while it would relieve judges of the weary task of
listening to the opinions of others of only second-rate importance ;
it excluded only Jurists who had never possessed a first-rate reputa-
tion, and in particular those who lived after Modestinus ².

² The opening words in the passage transcribed above from the ‘law os Cita-
tions,’ by which the statutory authority which the other four leading jurists had
always possessed is extended to Gaius, go to show that the latter was not a
‘iuris auctor,' and had never been invested with the ‘ius respondendi.' This in-
serence is supported by the fact that though his writings were so various. they
contained no responsa, though among them was a ‘liber de casibus: in which he
collected a large number os illustrative cases, many os which were imaginary,
while of the real ones none had been authoritatively pronounced upon by himself.
