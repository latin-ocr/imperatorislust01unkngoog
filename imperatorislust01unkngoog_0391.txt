contract as to make quasi-contract their most reasonable denomination ε
but the fault of justinian is that nothing which he says about quasi-
contract suggests any general criterion by which one can precisely draw
the line between it and contract proper, or which accounts for the exist·
enee os an obligation in the particular instances by which he illustrates
the conception. But the idea of quasi-delict, which is open to the same
objection, is further to be condemned as really unnecessary, as will
appear from the cases by which it is exemplified (Bk. iv. 5 infi), most of
which are instanccs os vicarious responsibility analogous to the liability in
tort of a railway company or other employer sor the wrong-doing or
negligence of its servants. Its existence is to be accounted for purely
on historical grounds (see Hunter's Roman Law p. xxxvi), and it is to be
regretted that Justinian tolerated its survival. The actual sources of
obligation in Roman law may more logically be arranged as follows:
(1) Agreement‚ comprising the four classes of contracts, the so-called
innominate contracts, and pacta vestita. (2) Quasi-contract, including
tutela, cura, negotiorum gestie, joint inheritance, joint ownership not
arising ex contractu, litis contestatio, and perhaps the unjust enrichment
of one man at the cost of another (cs. Tit. 14. 1 with Tit. 27. 6 inf.)-
(3) A person’s mere ‘unilateral ' expression of will (exemplified by some
cases of pollicitatio, e. g. Dig. 50. 12. 1. 1, ib. 2, though as a general
rule ‘ex nuda pollicitatione nulla actio nascitur ’ Paul. sent. rec. 5. 12. 9),
or that of another by whose decease one has taken a benefit (exemplified
by legacy and fideicommissum). (4) Judgment or magisterial order.
(5) Delict. For an enumeration of the sources of obligation in English
law see Sir W. R. Anson's Law of Contract (Introductory chapter).

The idea of agreement (conventio or pactio) underlies that os con·

Dig. 2. 14. 1. 2. Its analysis into the elements of offer or proposal and
acceptance is the work rather os general jurisprudence than of a particular
system, which has been done once for all by Savigny, Oblig. ξ 52,
System iii. ἕξ 140, 141: cf. Pollock's Principles of Contract, chap. i.
Pactio then is the genus of which contractus is the species: the
differentia lies in the circumstance that to certain pacta or pactiones a
civilis obligatio was annexed by the older Roman civil law in virtue
either of their nature, or of their being attended by some other fact
besides the mere fact of agreement. That, through which a pactum is
also a contract, is usually called its causa civilis, and of such causae
civiles there are four, viz. (1) res, delivery of ownership‚ possession or
detention of an object by the creditor, whence the four Real ContractS.
(2) The expression os the agreement in a certain verbal form (obligatio
verborum), that of question and answer (stipulatio) being regarded as the
verbal contract par excellence. (3) The employment of writing in a
manner peculiarly characteristic of the Romans, whence the obligatio
