182 INTRODUCTION To BOOK II.

and the introduction, already noticed, of the ⁶ inventory,' by far the
most important development was that effected by Justinian’s assi-
milation' of legacies and fideicommissa. When Gaius wrote, pre-
scribed forms were still required for the former, which were also
recovered by different remedies; but, by requiring the observance of
certain evidentiary solemnities in the creation of fideicommissa, by
freeing legacies from the trammels of language, and by the abolition
of the formulary procedure, later emperors had removed many of the
distinctions between them, and such as had remained were swept away
by Justinian's ordinance, that in future the mles and remedies of each
should apply to both indifferently, which also presented an oppor-
tunity for constructing one consistent enactment from the provisions
of the senatus consulta Trebellianum and Pegasianum, the latter os
which had halt* undone the judicious rule introduced by the former
for the assimilation of fideicommissarii to directi heredes, Many
unreasonable prohibitione, such as those of legacies to incertae per-
sonae, poenae nornine, and post mortem heredis, were also abolished
by Justinian, whose changes in connection with the querella inofficiosi
testamenti, both before and after the publication of the Institutes, are
noticed in the notes to Title 18.
