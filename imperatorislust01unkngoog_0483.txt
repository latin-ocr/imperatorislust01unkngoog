DOLUS, CULPA, ΛΝΒ casus. 471

appears to be that when a contract is for the interest of both partieS,
although their interests are rather adverse than identical, each is re-
sponsible for the least negligence: ' ‘ in contractibus bonae fidei serva-
tur, ut si quidem utriusque contrahentis commodum versetur, etiam
culpa, si unius solim, dolus malus tantummodo praestetur ’ Dig. 30.
108. 12. Yet there are some cases (e.g. mandatum and negotiorum·
gestio) in which, though the relation is all sor the interest of one party,
exacta diligentia is required from the other3 and others in which,
though both parties are interested, they are yet expected to show only ,
talem diligentiam qualem in suis rebus adhibere solent, e. g. parmen-3,
coheirS, and colegatees.

Accident, fortuitus casus (which is mentioned in Bk. iii. 14. 2 and
elsewhere in the Institutes), and dolus form the two extremes of a
chain of possible sets of circumstances, the responsibility for which
may be exhibited thus. For accident, and for such unintentional
faults and mistakes as could not have been guarded against by the

. utmost care, no one is answerable. Culpa levis entails liability on the

classes of persons enumerated under (r) supr. : they are required to
show exacta diligentia. The classes of persons enumerated under (2) are
expected to display the lower degree of diligence: they are answerable
sor culpa legis in concret0. Culpa lata and dolus entail liability in
every case.

The liability sor culpa in delict is treated in Bk. iv. 13. 3, and noteS.
