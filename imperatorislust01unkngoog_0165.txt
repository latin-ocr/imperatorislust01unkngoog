Tit. 20.] DE ATILIANO TUTORE, EYC. 153

mento heres existat, tamdiu ex isdem legibus tutor petendus
erat, qui desinebat tutor esse, si condicio existeret aut dies

recipiunt diem vel condicionem, velut emancipatiO, acceptilatio, heredi-
tatis aditio, servi opti0, datio libertatis, in totum vitiantur per temporis
vel condicionis adiectionem’ Dig. 50. 17. 77. When the condition was
satisfied or sulfilled, it was said, condicio existit τ when it was certain
that it had not been fulfilled, conditio deficit. N egative conditions are
fulfilled when the fact or event whose non-occurrence is contemplated
has become impossible ; and in some cases a condition was regarded as
fulfilled when in point of fact it had not been : (1) ‘iure civili receptum est,
quotiens per eum, cuius interest condicionem non impleri, fiat quominus
impleatur, perinde haberi ac si impleta condicio fuisset ³ Dig. 42. 1. 161.
(2) 11 the fulfilment os the condition is prevented by some other person's
arbitrarily refusing consent or co·operation, ‘ plerumque haec condicio, si
uxorem duxerit, si dederit, si fecerit, ita accipi oportet, quod per eum non
stet, quominus ducat, det aut faciat ’ Dig. 28. 7. 23: or is the person
entitled on fulfilment is prevented from sulfilling by other accidental cir-
cumstanceS.

As regards the effect of a condition annexed to a disposition :

(a) If suspensive, the disposition, until it is fulfiued, is there and in
existence, and does not come into existence only on its fulfilment: ac-
cordingly, it may have legal consequences even though, through sailure
of the condition, it is subsequently annihilated: e. g. a second will, in
which the heir is instituted sub condicione, revokes a prior one, even
though the condition is never fulfflled and the will as a whole thus never
takes effect, Dig. 28. 3. 16. But rights conferred by the disposition are
merely conditional, and can have no practica] effect until the condition is
sulfilled: speaking precisely, there is only a chance of having the right,
which chance by the sulfilment os the condition becomes an actuality : a
contingent becomes a vested right.

(b) If resolutive, the disposition has presently all the effects which it
would have, had it been unconditional, though these are liable to be can·
celled and rendered null by the future fulfilment of the condition.

On the sulfilment osa suspensive condition, the disposition which has
hitherto been conditional becomes unconditionally operative, and its
operation is carried back to the time at which it was made: ‘ cum enirn
semel condicio extitit, perinde habetur ac si illo tempore, quo stipulatio
interposita est, sine condicione facta esset ’ Dig. 20. 4. 10. 1 1 : this rule is
expressed in the formula ‘condicio existens ad initium negotii retrotra-
hitur.' On the sulfilment os a resolutive condition, the whole effect of the
disposition is nullified, the condition operating retroactively so as to
place the parties as far as possible in the position in which they would
have been had the disposition never been made; Dig. 6. 1. 41 ; 13. 7.
13. pr. ; 18. 2. 4. 3. For the effect os impossible conditions see on Bk. ii.
14 10 ins. and ct Bk. iii. ¹9- 11.

By dies, in connection with dispositions, is meant the fixing of a time,
which may mark either (a) the commencement of a right ι (b) its termina·
