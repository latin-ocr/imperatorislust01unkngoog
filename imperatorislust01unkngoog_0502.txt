490 INT RODUC Τ ION TO BOOK JV.

Private code. The fourth Book of Gaius would seem to be an ill-
arranged attempt to deal with actio in both os these aspects. It can-
not be contended that it deals solely with Remedial rights: Gaius’
own explanation of the term actio in his opening paragraphs shows
that he is thinking of an ‘ action ⁹ rather than of a ‘right of action‚’
based, as it is, upon peculiarities of Procedure and Pleading. In
point os fact a very considerable proportion of the Book deals with
Procedure pure and simple: in other wordS, ‘Procedure is treated
partly indeed in its formal character, but still more in its material
character: . . . . that is to say, not so far as it is merely the method
of realizing pre-existing rights, but rather so far as its stages are titles
which, like Dispositions and Torts, themselves originate new rights
and new obligations ¹.’

The compilers of the Institutes, however, seem to have had a very
inadequate conception of Gaius' scheme, and indeed to have troubled
themselves very little in this part of the work to follow out consistently
the principle of arrangement for which they were indebted to him.
Strictly speaking, of course, all the Titles between the fifth and the
end of the Book should have related to actions in some sense or
other: but they seem to have considered it better to give the heading
‘ de actionibus' to a single Title (6), in which all conceivable rights
of action are classified upon various principles of division, and to
append to this a number of subsidiary Titles dealing mostly with
topics discussed by Gaius in a far closer and more logical connection
with his main subject. The effect of this is to give an air of deadness
to the whole treatment, and to disable the compilers from justisying
the place assigned in the fourth Book to some matters for which
Gaius himself might possibly have offered some reasonable defence.
For instance, if it is right to describe in Book 111 the extent to which
a paterfamilias profits by the contracts of a son in his power, or a
master by those of his slave (Tit. 28), that too must be the proper
place to explain what corresponding liability he incurs by them: but
this is discussed in Book 1v, Tit. 7, while Titles 8 and 9, though
placed where they are after Gaius, would have occupied a far more
logical position between Titles 5 and 6, in connection with Delict and
Quasi-delict. No doubt this failure to carry out the original plan of
arrangement is in a large measure to be explained by the great change
which had occurred in the nature os Procedure proper between the
composition of the two works. The mode in which an action was
conducted in Justinian's time was so formleSS, so free from the tram-
