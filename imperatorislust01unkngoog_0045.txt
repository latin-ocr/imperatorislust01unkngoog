of the ius gentium, partly of the indigenous law of the provincial
population ; though, on the analogy of the edict of the praetor
urbanus, the latter would have been excluded. Mr. Long ¹ sayS,
however, that they were founded on the edictum urbanum, though
they likewise comprehended rules applicable only to the admini-
stration of justice in the provinces. They are osten mentioned by
CicerO, who says (e. g. in his letters to Atticus vi. 1) that he pro-
mulgated in his province two edicta, one provinciale, which, among
other matterS, contained everything that related to the publicani, and
another, to which he gives no name, relating to matters of which he
ἥγε, ‘ex edicto et postulari et fieri solent! As to all the rest he made
no edict, but declared that he would frame all his decreta on the edicta
urbana. The provincial edicts may thus perhaps be regarded as in some
way serving the purposes which, for the generalisations of modern social
science, are obtained by collections of statistics in various parts of the
world. The edict of the praetor peregrinus was a collection of legal
mles which were found to be observed in common by all the peoples
with whom Rome was acquainted; and the formulation of such rules
would be facilitated, and their number largely increased‚ by a com·
parison of the various provincial ediets. The institution of the pro·
vinces, and, with them, of the edictum provinciale, must have given a
great impulse to the development of the edict of the praetor pere-
grinus ; through the medium of the latter they were brought into
relation with the edictum urbanum. We do not know whether the
work of Ofilius, referred to by Pomponius in Dig. 1. a. 2, was an
attempt to collect and arrange the various edicta; but we shall see
that when the edict was systematised by Salvius JulianuS, in the reign
of Hadrian, he probably incorporated in it some portion of the pro-
vincial legislation (see p. 43 inf.).

The activity of the praetor urbanus in this mode of indirect legisla-
tion was due, to a very large extent, to the lex Aebutia, which had cast
upon him the task of devising and elaborating a new code of procedure,
and thereby enormously increased his power of altering and extending
the substantive law. But it was also due in no small degree to the
exclusiveness of the Roman legal system, and to the consequent ne-
cessity of discovering some ruleS‚ other than the rules of the ius civile,
by which the commercial relations between Romans and peregrini
