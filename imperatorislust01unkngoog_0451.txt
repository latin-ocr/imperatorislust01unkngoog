T11.2⁶.] DE MANDA TO. 439

bonos mores est, veluti si Titius de furto aut damno faciendo
aut de iniuria facienda tibi mandet. licet enim poenam istius
facti nomine praestiteriS, non tamen ullam habes adversus
Titium actionem.

Is qui exsequitur mandatum non debet excedere fines 8
mandati. ut ecce si quis usque ad centum aureos mandaverit
tibi, ut fundum emeres vel ut pro Titio spondereS‚ neque
pluris emere debes neque in ampliorem pecuniam fideiubere,
alioquin non habebis cum eo mandati actionem: adeo quidem,
ut Sabino et Cassio placuerit, etiam si usque ad centurn
aureos cum eo agere veliS, inutiliter te acturum: diversae
scholae auctores recte te usque ad centum aureos acturum
existimant: quae sententia sane benignior est. quod si minoris
emeriS, habebis scilicet cum eo actionem, quoniam qui mandat,
ut sibi centum aureorum fundus emeretur, is utique mandasse
intellegitur, ut minoris si posset emeretur.

ὁ Β. Gaius seems to have been in two minds as to the rights of an
agent who went beyond the price at which he had been commissioned
to buy; in his Institutes he adopts the Sabinian view (iii. 161), while in
his res quotidianae (Dig. 17. 1. 4) he says ‘ sed Proculus recte eum usque
ad pretium statutum acturum existimat, quae sententia sane benignior
est.²

The principal duties of the agent are—to properly execute his com-
mission‚ Dig. 17. 1. 5. 1, or to give notice, if possible, when he is un-
avoidably prevented, ib. 27. 23 in its execution to display exacta dili·
gentia, Cod. 4. 35. 133 to execute it himself in person, unless he has
express or implied authority to depute the business to an agent of his
own, in which case he is answerable sor all shortcomings of his subor-
dinate which he was or ought to have been aware of (culpa in eligendo),
Dig. ib. 8. 3 ; to give up all property which eomes into his hands in the
discharge of his dutieS, unless lost or destroyed through no fault of his
own, ib. 8. 7 and 10, along with fruits and interest, if to produce these
be its nature 3 to restore, at the expiring of his commission, all that has
been entrusted to him; to give full accounts of his receipts and ex-
penditure to the mandator, and to allow the latter to exercise all rights
of action which, while acting in his behalt} he has acquired against third
persons

The principal's remedy against the agent sor the breach of any os these
duties was the actio mandati directa, condemnation in which entailed
infamia, Book iv. 16. 2 inf„ though in Cod. 4. 35. 21 this effect is said
to ensue only where the agent has been guilty of fraud: cf. cic. pro
Rosc. Am. 38 ‘mandati constitutum est iudicium non minus turpe
quam furti.³
