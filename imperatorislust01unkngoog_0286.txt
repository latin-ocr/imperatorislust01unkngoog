§ 5. By the civil law the institutus was not bound to accept or decline
the hereditas within any definite time, though such a period was often
fixed by the testator, non-acceptance within which caused forfeiture of
delatio to the substituti. Where this was done, both the prescribed
interval and the signification of acceptance were called cretio, Gaius ii.
164, the latter was required to be made in a recognized form (ib. 166)
and before witnesses (Varro, de ling. Lat. 6. 81, Cic. ad Att. 13. 46). Two
kinds of cretio were distinguished, vulgaris (Gaius ii. 171. 2), by which
the institutus was bound to accept within so many days only after he
knew of his institution and was able to make aditio, and continua (Gaius
ii. 172, 3), which was not so favourable to the institutus, because the
time began to run immediately on the testator’s decease, and might have
wholly elapsed before he was able to take advantage of his rights or
was even aware of them. The solemn forms of creti0, which are pre-
served by Gaius, were abolished ΑΛ). 407 by Honorius and Arcadius,
Cod. 6. 30. 17, though of course this did not in any way prevent testators
from still making the institution conditional on acceptance within a fixed
time from the date of decease.

But though no rule of law required a reasonably prompt aditio, it was
always open to the deceased’s creditors (and we may add to legateeS‚
fideicommissarii, substituti, and other persons jointly instituted) to peti-
tion the praetor to fix a time within which it must be made, ‘solet
praetor, postulantibus hereditariis creditoribuS, tempus constituere, intra
quod si velit adeat hereditatem3 si minuS, ut liceat creditoribus bona
defuncti vendere’ Gaius ii. 167. The interval so fixed was called ⁶ spa-
tium deliberandi: ait praetor, si tempus ad deliberandum petet, dabo’
