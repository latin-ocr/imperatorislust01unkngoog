statum recipiunt. Relegati autem patres in insulam in po- 2
testate sua liberos retinent: et e contrario liberi relegati in
potestate parentum remanent. Poenae servus effectus filios 3
in potestate habere desinit. servi autem poenae efficiuntur,
qui in metallum damnantur et qui bestiis subiciuntur. Filius 4
familias si militaverit, vel si senator vel consul suerit sactus,
manet in patris potestate. militia enim vel consularia dignitas
patris potestate filium non liberat. sed ex constitutione
nostra summa patriciatus dignitas ilico ab imperialibus codi-
cillis praestitis a patria potestate liberat. quis enim patiatur
patrem quidem posse per emancipationis modum suae potes-
tatis nexibus filium relaxare, imperatoriam autem celsitudinem
non valere eum quern sibi patrem elegit ab aliena eximere
potestate? Si ab hostibus captus fuerit parens», quamvis 5
servus hostium fiat, tamen pendet ius liberorum propter ius
postliminii: quia hi, qui ab hostibus capti sunt, si reversi

anomalous cases, however, the pater was deprived of his potestas
as a punishment, without the child being capite minutus: e. g. for ex-
posing his children, Cod. 8. 52. 2, sor compelling them to prostitute
themselveS, Cod. 11. 402 6, and for contracting an incestuous marriage,
Nov. 12. 2.

§2- Relegation was banishment unattended with any loss of civil
rights: ‘ relegati in insulam in potestate suos liberos retinent, quia et alia
omnia iura sua retinent: tantum enim insula eis egredi non licet : et
bona quoque sua omnia retinent praeter ea, si quae eis adempta sunt ³
Dig. 48. 22. 7. 2-4. So too Ovid says (Trist. 4. 9. 11) ‘ Omnia. . . Caesar
mihi iura reliquit, Et sola est patria poena carere mea.²

§3. For the poenae servus see on Tit. 3. 4 supr. Loss of liberty of
course entailed loss of citizenship, whether the master were ‘ poena' or
any. one else, Tit. 16. 1 inf.

ξ 4. There had always been certain dignities, by the attainment of
which a child in power was released therefrom without undergoing
capitis deminutio t thus a son who became flamen Dialis, and a daughter
who became virgo Vestalis (Gaius iii. 114, i. 130) were released from
power, though still remaining members of their old agnatic family. The
Patriciate of the later Empire seems to have originated in the old prac-
tice οἱ calling persons of advauced age pater as a compliment or token
σί respect, Horace, Ep. i. 6. 54-55, Νέρων . . . πατέρα αὐτὸν ἀεὶ ὀνομάζων
Dio CasS. 63. 17, ‘ad Ulpianum praefectum praetorio et parentem meum ³
Alexander in Cod. 4. 65. 4. Besides the Patriciate, justinian attached
this effect also to elevation to sundry other high dignitieS, especially that
of consul and bishop, Nov. 81. pr. 3.
