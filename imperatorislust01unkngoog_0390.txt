378 INS T I T UT ION ΠΜ LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. 111.

summa divisio in duo genera diducitur: namque aut civiles
sunt aut praetoriae. civiles sunt, quae aut legibus constitutae
aut certe iure civili comprobatae sunt. praetoriae sunt, quas
praetor ex sua iurisdictione constituit, quae etiam honorariae
2 vocantur. Sequens divisio in quattuor species diducitur: aut
enim ex contractu sunt aut quasi ex contractu aut ex male·
ficio aut quasi ex maleficiO. prius est, ut de his quae ex
contractu sunt dispiciamus. harum aeque quattuor species

rar-iae obviously does not correspond with that explained in Excursus V
inf. into civil and natural : it has reference, as appears from the text, to
the legislative organ by which it was declared that such or such an act
or event should engender a (civil) obligation. In this sense civiles
obligationes are those which were made actionable by the organs of the
civil law—by a lex, plebiscitum, senatusconsult, imperial constitution, or
by the action of the jurists : obligationes praetoriae are those which owed
their actionability to the edict: ‘quas praetor ex sua iurisdictione con·
stituit ' seems to mean ‘quas, occasione a iuris dicundi munere sumpta,
decretis primum, deinde edicto perpetuo constituit!

§ 2. The sources of obligations are thus enumerated by Modestinus in
Dig. 44. 7. 52: res—verba—consensus (the three forms of contractual
liability)—lex—ius honorarium—necessitas—peccatum. Lex and neces·
sitas he explains as follows: ‘ lege obligamur, cum obtemperantes legibus
aliquid secundum praeceptum legis aut contra facimus : ..... necessitate
obligantur quibus non licet aliud facere, quam quod praeceptum est:
quod evenit in necessario herede) The fourfold division of justinian,
¹though more complete than that given by Gaius in his Institutes (iii. 88),
is in effect derived from the same writer’s liber tertius aureorum (Dig.
44. 7. 5.), from which Justinian literally takes his instances of quasi-
contract and quasi-delict, and in which (ἕξ 1 and 5) these terms occur,
though a few lines above they are comprised under the perplexing
expression ‘variarum causarum figurae.’ The meaning of these four
sources of obligations will appear sufficiently from the text relating to
them respectively: but they do not comprehend all the obligations of
Roman law, and therefore the classification must be condemned as in
the first place inexhaustive. Contracts (sensu Romano) are those agree·
ments which were actionable under even the old civil law: but in course
os time a considerable number of other agreements were made actionable
by the influence of the jurists, the edict, and imperial enactment: in
none of these, which the commentators call pacta vestita, to distinguish
them from pacta nuda, was the obligation said to arise ex contractu, and
in fact they have no place whatever in Justinian’s arrangement. No
system os law probably can dispense with the notion of quasi-contract,
sor there must always be circumstances in which one person is placed
under an obligation to another without any promise, express or implied,
made by him to the latter, and which yet so closely resemble those of
