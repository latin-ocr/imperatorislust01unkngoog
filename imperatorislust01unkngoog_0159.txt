Tit. 16.] DE CAPJTJS MINUTIONE. 147

minima. Maxima est capitis deminutio, curn aliquis simul l
et civitatem et libertatem amittit. quod accidit in his, qui
servi poenae efficiuntur atrocitate sententiae, vel liberti ut
ingrati circa patronos condemnati, vel qui ad pretium par-
ticipandum se venumdari passi sunt. Minor sive media est 2
capitis deminutio, cum civitas quidem amittitur, libertas vero
retinetur. quod accidit ei, cui aqua et igni interdictum fuerit,
vel ei, qui in insulam deportatus est. Minima est capitis 3
deminutiO, cum et civitas et libertas retinetur, sed status
hominis commutatur. quod accidit in his, qui, cum sui iuris

position in respect of legal right3‚ and this is usually determined by
reference to three ‘momenta,' libertaS, civitas, and familia, the importance
of which in this connection was so great that they came to be regarded
as specific status themselveS, cf. p. 79 supr. Hence the dictum that no
man can have a status unless, to begin with, be is free3 and the state-
ment of Paulus, adopted in § 4 inf„ is amplified by Modestinus, Dig. 4.
5. 4, who addS‚ ‘hodie enirn incipit statum habere :' a slave, until he is
manumitted, has no more a ‘ status ' than he has a ⁶ caput.’ 1t is in this
specific sense that status is used here : by defining capitis deminutio as
prioris status commutatio Justinian means that when a man ‘capite
minuitur’ he either (1) loses the freedom which he possessed before, or
(2) though retaining his steedom, ceases to be a citizen of Rome, or
finally (3) while remaining liber and civiS, ceases to belong to the familia
of which he has hitherto been a member. Similarly caput, in the ex-
pression capitis deminutiO, bears a close analogy to status in this specific
sense: it means the rights a man enjoys in virtue of being free, or a
civis, or a member of a family: by being ‘ capite deminutus' he loses
some or all of these rights,

§L For some modes of capitis deminutio maxima which were ob·
solete in Justinian's time see on Tit. 3. 4 supr.: to them may be added
surrender by the pater patratus to a foreign state for an offence against

Intemational Law, Livy 5. 36. For the cases mentioned here in the
text see the note referred t0.

§2 For deportatio and aquae et ignis interdictio see on Tit. 12. 1
supr. Capitis deminutio media occurred also when a Roman citizen
became civis of another town, e. g. a civitas peregrina or a Latin colony,
between which and Rome there was not a complete community of civil
rights, Cic. pro Balbo 11.12, pro Caec. 33. 34, de Orat. 1. 40. In his
note on Gaius ι. 161 Mr. Poste supposes that there was a capitis de·
minutio media when a Latinus was degraded to peregrinus by interdic-
tion or deportation, and this is not improbable, as Latinus had many of
the rights of civitas (see on Tit. 5. 3 supr. ), but there is no express
authority for the statement.
