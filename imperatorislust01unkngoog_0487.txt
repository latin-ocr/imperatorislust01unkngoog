CORREALITY ΑΜ) SOLJDARJTY. 475

tion. This resembles the former, iu that two or more creditors (correi
stipulandi or credendi) are entitled against one debtor, or two or more
debtors (correi promittendi or debendi) are bound to one creditor in
respect of one and the same obligation-obJect, and so far we may
say that every correal includes in itself a solidary obligation‚ each of
the two or more creditors being entitled, and each of the two or more
debtors being bound, in solidum. But it differs in that there is not
only one obligation·object, but only one obligation. The unity of the
object here follows necessarily from the unity of the obligation itself :
where the liability is solidary, it arises from extraneous causes, for,
given a variety of obligatione, the natural and usual consequence
would be a corresponding variety of objects.

It is thus the unity or identity of the obligation which distinguishes
correal from merely solidary obligation: or, to put the matter in
another form, when there is correality‚ there is, objectively, one
single obligation, to which a variety of persons are subjectively
related in solidum: and their subjective relation may be different.

There is, objectively‚ but oue single obligation. Hence any act or
event (and not merely performance or its equivalent‚ as in cases of
solidarity) which puts an end to the objective existence of that single
obligation between the creditor and one of the debtorS, or the debtor
and one of the creditors, extinguishes it between them all 3 e. g. solutio
or performance‚ acceptilatio, and novatio (Dig. 46. 2. 31. ι). Com-
pensatio, or set-off, extinguishes correal obligation only if it goes to the
whole debt‚ Dig. 20. 4. 4 : but if correal debt or A is sued he cannot set-
off money owed to correal debtor B, unless he and B are partners, Dig.
45. 2. 10. So, too, if the creditor sued one of the debtorS, or one of
the creditors sued the debtor, the obligation was extinguished for all by
the action’s reaching the stage of litis contestatiO‚ Gaius iii. 180, Dig.
45. 1. 116,- ib. 2. ος ib. 16'3 46. 1. 5. In respect of passive correal
obligation this was altered by Justinian's constitution in Cod. 8. 41. 28,
which enacted that the debt should not be extinguished by litis con-
testatiO, but only by satisfaction of the creditor: for active correal
obligation the old rule seems to have continued, Dig. 45. ο. 2 ; 46. 1. 53
46. 2. 31. 1. Further consequences of the unity of the obligation are
that any act of a correus debendi, by which its performance· becomes
impossible or more difficult‚ prejudices the rest: ‘ ex duobus reis eius-
dem Stichi promittendi factis alterius factum alteri quoque nocet ’ Dig.
