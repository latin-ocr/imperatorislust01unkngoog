EARLIER HIS T ORY OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 643

The constant tendency of the praetor to enlarge the sphere of his
extraordinaria cognitio, after the establishment of the empire, at the
expense of the regular procedure by formula, paved the way to the
total abolition of the latter. An even stronger influence, which was
perpetually working against the ordo iudiciorum privatorum, was the
new appellate jurisdiction3 for, as has been observed, formulae were
employed only in courts of lowest instance ¹. Eventually the sormu-
lary procedure was abolished by Diocletian, Λα). 294, magistrates
being compelled to hear and decide suits themselves through all their
stages 3 and even when, from stress of business, they were obliged to
refer an occasional action to a iudex, their relation to the latter was
no longer that of the older system3 the proceedings were no longer
divided between ius and iudicium, but the whole of them were dele-
gated ; magistratus and iudex, so far as the administration of Justice
is concerned, are interchangeable terms. As is observed by Mr. Poste ²,
the libellary procedure in use in the time of Justinian was essentially
the same as cognitio extraordinaria ⁸.

¹ A sure index of the increasing activity os the extraordinaria cog-nitio is the
frequent use of the expression ⁴ iudex pedaneus ⁸ (χαμαιδικαστ-ἡς, Theophilus) by the
classical juristS. This originated in the practice of calling the magistrate himself
‘ iudex‚’ which was only natural when he took to personally hearing and deciding
many actions-»5 ⁸ iudex pedaneus ⁹ is the iudex instructed by formula.

² Gaius p. 65 7.

¹ Cf. Bk. iv. 15. 8 supr. Several topics which are of importanee in the formulary
procedure have been omitted in this excursus because they demand discussion
under the later system as well, and consequently are touched upon in the notes to
the text of Bk. iv: e. g. Prooessnal Agency‚ Title 103 satisdatio, Title 11 3 Prescrip-

tion and Pendency, Title 123 Inter-diets, Title 153 Restraints upon reckless Litiga-
tion, Title 16. ·
