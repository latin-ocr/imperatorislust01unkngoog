hoc secundum antiquam observationem totum parenti adquirat
(quae enim invidia est, quod ex patris occasione profectum
est, hoc ad eum reverti ?): quod autem ex alia causa sibi filius
familias adquisivit, huius usum fructum quidem patri adquiret,
dominium autem apud eum remaneat, ne, quod ei suis labor-
ibus vel prospera fortuna accessit, hoc in alium perveniens
2 luctuosum ei procedat. Hocque a nobis dispositum est et in
ea specie, ubi parens emancipando liberum ex rebus quae
adquisitionem effugiunt sibi part'em tertiam retinere si voluerat
licentiam ex anterioribus constitutionibus habebat quasi pro
pretio quodammodo emancipationis et inhumanum quid acci-
debat, ut filius rerum suarum ex hac emancipatione dominio
pro parte defraudetur et, quod honoris ei ex emancipatione
additum est, quod sui iuris effectus est, hoc per rerum deminu-
tionem decrescat. ideoque statuimuS, ut parens pro tertia
bonorum parte dominii, quam retinere poterat, dimidiam non
dominii rerum, sed usus fructus retineat: ita etenim et res

profession, it being enacted that of whatever a son in power acquired as
soldier, e.g. outfit‚ pay, booty, gifts, legacieS‚ etc. from comrades, etc., he
should be absolute owner, under the name of peculium castrense, with
full powers of disposition both inter vivos and by will, Dig. 49. 17. 1 1 : if
he died without disposing of it in the latter way, it went to the pater, iure
communi, as peculium. No further changes were made for about three
hundred years ; but under Constantine the earnings of a filiusfamilias in
certain offices of the public service were made entirely his own (peculium
quasi-castrense) except that as a rule he could not dispose of thern by will
(Tit. 11. 6 inf), a privilege first conferred by Justinian; and the term
was gradually made to include all official, public, and ecclesiastica]
salarieS, fees earned by advocates, and gists from the emperor. Under
Justinian the succession to peculium castrense or quasi-castrense, if the
owner died intestate, was governed by the ordinary rules ι the pater could
succeed only as heres, not iure peculii, and was postponed to certain
other relations of the deceased. By another enactment of Constantine
bona materna, property descending to a child in power from his or her
mother, were in future to belong to the child, the pater, however, having
the administration and usufruct during his lifetime. This, which is com-
monly called peculium adventitium (in contradistinction to peculium
profectitium, property of his own which the pater allowed the child to
enjoy without prejudicing his right to resume it at any moment) was ex-

all bona materni generis, property coming to the child from the mother or
