DE SUCCESSIONE COGNATORUM.

Post suos heredes eosque, quos inter suos heredes praetor
et constitutiones vocant, et post legitimos (quo numero sunt
adgnati et hi, quos in locum adgnatorum tam supra dicta
senatus consulta quam nostra erexit constitutio) proximos
cognatos praetor vocat. Qua parte naturalis cognatio spec· 1
tatur. nam adgnati capite deminuti quique ex his progeniti
sunt ex lege duodecim tabularum inter legitimos non ha-
bentur, sed a praetore tertio ordine vocantur, exceptis solis
tantummodo fratre et sorore emancipatiS, non etiam liberis
eorum, quos lex Anastasiana cum fratribus integri iuris con-
stitutis vocat quidem ad legitimam fratris hereditatem sive
sororiS, non aequis tamen partibuS, sed cum aliqua deminutione,
quam facile est ex ipsius constitutionis verbis colligere, aliis

ing to the mode of division. 1f this was per capita, all the joint heirs
who took benefited equally by the refusal or inability of those who did
not3 is it was per stirpeS, the accrual enured primarily to the benefit
only of those who belonged to the same stirps with them that had failed,
Dig. 37. 4. 12. pn, others gained only if there was no one left of that
stirps to take.

Ἧι. V. Failing sui and the nearest agnate, the Twelve Tables had
given the inheritance to the gentiles of the deceased3 ‘ si adgnatus nec
escit, gentilis familiam nancitor.’ In iii. 17 Gaius alluades to a definition
os gentiles in an earlier part of his work, which, however, has been lost,
and the best account we have of them is that of Cicer0, Top. 6, cited by
Mr. Poste in his note on the passage of Gaius referred to. Who they
were precisely is of no practical importance, sor Gaius observes that
even in his day the whole os the law relating to the subject was obsolete‚
‘ totum gentilicium ius in desuetudinem abiisse! There was in fact no
longer any civil law successor to an intestate in default of sui and
agnates 3 the gap was filled by the praetor, who through the system of
bonorum possessio substituted for the gentiles a third order of claimantS,
ranking aster liberi and legitimi, viz. the deceased cognates or next of
ltin, in their several degrees of proximity. Between two or more cog-
nates related in the same degree the division was always in capita.
