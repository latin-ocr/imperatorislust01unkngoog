naturale est quam eo genere quidque dissolvere quo colligatum est. Ideo
verborum obligatio verbis tollitur; nudi consensus obligatio contrario
consensu dissolvitur’ Dig. 50. 17. 353 cf. Dig. 46. 3. 80. Obligations
incurred literis (Excursus VIII inf.) could be extinguished by the creditor's
entering the receipt of an equivalent sum from the debtor on the opposite
page of the ledger (accepti relatio : cf. Gaius iv, 64) 3 and Gaius tells us
(iii. 17 3- 5) that debts incurred in mancipation form or by judgment were
properly dissolved by a corresponding nexi liberatio, a ‘species imagi-
nariae solutionis per aes et libram,’ employed even in his own day to
acknowledge payment of judgment debts and legata per damnationem ς
see Poste’s Gaius pp. 443, 672.

But a more important distinction between the modes in which obliga·
tions may be invalidated or rendered ineffectual, not alluded to in this
Title, is the following. To some events the law attaches the effect of
altogether extinguishing the obligatio ; it ceases to exist, and there is no
longer any vinculum iuris between the parties ; the obligatio, as it is said,
ipso iure tollitur, perimitur, evanescit. Under the older law, unless it
was discharged in this manner, an obligation was altogether unaffected ς
so that (e. g.) if a solemn form of payment was prescribed which the
debtor did not observe, he could be sued and forced to pay again. But
later a new mode arose in which a debtor could defeat his creditor3
though he could not deny the existence of the obligati0‚ he might himself
have a right which he could set up against that of the other, whereby his
claim, if asserted by legal proceSS, could be successfully repelled; ipso
iure, the obligatio still subsists, but it is rendered inoperative, and in effect
cancelled, by the counter right of the debtor, or, as it is said, ope excep·
tionis actor summovetur, removetur, expellitur, excluditur 3 he is kept at
bay by the plea of the defendant. The processual significance9f excep·
tiones is treated in the notes to Bk. iv. 13 inf.; here all that need be
considered is their operation. In some cases this is stronger and more
potent than in others ; in some the plea will avail at all times and under
all circumstances, in others it will be only temporary (Bk. iv. 13. 8—11
infi). Those which have the stronger effect practieally (though not in
form) extinguish the obligation, or, as Mr. Poste puts it, they neutralize
naturalis as well as civilis obligati0‚ as is shown by the fact that if the
debtor pays by mistake he can recover by condictio indebiti ; ‘indebitum
autem solutum accipimus non solum si omnino non debeatur, sed et si
per aliquam exceptionem peti non poterat3 quare hoc quoque repeti
poterit, nisi sciens se tutum exceptione solvit’ Dig. 12. 6. 26. 3, ‘adeo
autem perpetua exceptio parit condictionem, ut Iulianus scripsit, si
emptor fundi damnaverit heredem suum ut venditorem nexu venditi
liberaret, mox venditor ignorans rem tradiderit posse eum fundum con·
dicere, idemque et si debitorem suurn damnaverit liberare et ille
ignorans solverit ’ Dig. ib. 7. Among exceptions with this greater
