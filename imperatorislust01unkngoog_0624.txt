ΟΝ THE EARLIER HISTORY 01⁴· ROMAN CIVIL
PROCEDURE.

A favourite subject of speculation with the politica! philosophers
of the 17th and 18th cenmries was the social condition of man in
the remote ages anterior to his union with his fellows in the organiza-
tion called the state, and the process by which this latter first came
into existence, with all its paraphernalia os legislatures, judicial insti-

agreed, in the main, in holding the theory known as that of the
‘ Soeial Compact,' though their respective politice] prejudices led them
to differ largely as to the actual form of government in which the
Compact historically resulted. The age was one in which a prtbri
reasoning was in high repnte, and their method was to disregard the

moral truths.’ Upon the former question there was greater diversity
of opinion. On the one hand man was represented as living in a
golden age, of which univerml peace, simplicity of manners, and free-
dom from the constant 2011 of modern society were the leading cha-

inevitable accompaniment of law and political organisation. On the
other, his state was said to be one of internecine war with all around
him: every man's hand was against his neighbour: the strong man·
armed alone was secure of life and property, and that only so long
as no one stronger than himself appeared to, try conclusions with
him.

Though the latter of these theories is no less pure speculation than
the former, it cannot be denied that it is largely supported by the
actual evidence afforded us by primitive societies. As by the sossils
