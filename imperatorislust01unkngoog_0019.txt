REFORMS OF SERVIUS TULLIUS. 7

thus had to cast about for a new system of political association, and
a basis for this was found in the principle of local contiguity. He
divided the plebs into local tribeS, each with its own president, each
occupying a certain district, and each responsible for a certain quota
of mxation and a certain military contingent. F our of these were
‘ tribus urbanae,’ others, the number of which seems to have fluctuated
with circumstances, ‘tribus rusticae ;’ but the former only had any
political influence until the plebeian secession, though it is possible
that for politica] purposes the members of the country belonged to the
town tribes also·

Indeed, the importance of the plebeian tribe constitution was not at
first political at all. The plebS, being now organized, had its comitia
tributa, but this comitia does not seem to have reacted on the old
constitution till a later period ; the purpose of its meetings was as yet
merely peaceful and local, not national or aggressive. The plebs in
its new organization first became a political factor proper through its
influence on the military arrangements of the state. The relative im-
portance of infantry and cavalry was now reversed3 the proportion os
the former to the latter in each legion was increased by one third, and
the people in arms exchanged the name of ‘celeres' for that of ‘classis
procincta’ (cf. Gaius ii. 101, Inst. ii. 10. ι), the change indicating the
new prominence of the plebeian over the patrician clement.

It cannot be doubted—in spite of the dissent of Niebuhr—that this
tribal arrangement comprehended the patricians, the old populus in
its three tribes. Its very object was to make the plebs an integral
clement in the state, and this could not have been done unless the
reform of Servius had embraced every citizen, every inch of Roman
soil. In point of fact, the new arrangement was based on the prin·
ciple of local contiguity, and therefore comprehended the whole of
Roman territory, large portions of which were in patrician occupation-
Theoretically, then, no one could prevent the patricians from taking
action, is they pleased, under Servius' new constitution: ‘they belonged
to this or that district, and therefore to this or that (plebeian) tribe;
they could therefore, is they pleased, appear in the new comitia, serve
among the tribal infantry contingent, and pay the plebeian tributum.’
Practically, however, it is obvious that in their pride of ratze, in their
haughty assumption of superiority‚ they would do none of these
things ς they would hold aloof, and content themselves with the
rights which they derived from a constitution given them by kings
of the Ramnes or Quirites. Thus the comitia tributa, in its origin,
was in fact purely plebeian, and its resolutions plebeiscita; a name
