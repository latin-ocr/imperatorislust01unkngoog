but which was unable to 'injuriously affect rights acquired under the
previous contract by third persons τ ‘ [re secuta] non tam hoc agitur, ut a
pristino negotio discedamus, quam ut novae obligationes constituantur'
Dig. 2. 14. 58.

Among the modes ‘quibus obligatio tollitur’ described by Gaius is
the commencement of an action, litis contestatiO, which, if the action
were a iudicium legitimum, produced a quasi-novative effect, termed by
the commentators novatio necessaria3 the very delivery os the formula
in the action by the praetor to the iudex extinguished the defendant’s
debt, and substituted for it a new obligation, viz. the legal liability to be
condemned if the plaintiff proved his ease, Gaius iii. 180, 181. It dif-
ἴοι-311, however, in its operation from novatio proper (novatio voluntaria),
for it left the original obligation subsisting naturaliter, Dig. 12. 6. 60, and,
as a consequence, did not destroy accessory rights, such as μαι-3111103,
hypotheca etc.‚ Dig. 46. 2. 29. Of this process-consumptiom as it is ·
called, there are still traces in the Corpus iuriS, but the general rule
under Justinian is that litis contestatio no longer extinguishes the cre-
ditor’s right, Bk. iv. 13. 10 inf„ Cod. 3. 1. 13. 2 and 53 3. 10. 1-pr. It
must indeed have ceased to extinguish it ipso iure with the disappearance
of iudicia legitima under Diocletian, Λα). 294 ; but now indeed it no
longer enables it to be counteracted ope exceptionis3 an obligatio is
destroyed, not by the bringing of an action, but only by its adjudication,
so that we cease to read of the exceptio rei in iudicium deductae, which
is swallowed up in the exceptio rei iudicatae, Dig. 9. 44. 3 ; 14. 5. 4. 5:
see on Bk. iv. 13. 5 inf. N ovatio necessaria is also said by Gaius to be
produced by judgment, sententia, res iudicata3 for its effects‚ which do
not belong here, see Poste’s Gaius, p. 447.

Among modes of extinction operating ipso iure, which are not here
noticed by Justinian, are physical impossibility of performance arising
ex post facto without default of the debtor, Dig. 46. 3. 92 ς ib. 98. 8 ; ib.
107 : cs. note on Tit. 19. 1 supr. ; and in some cases death os one os the
parties to the contract, as in societas (Tit. 25. 5 supr.) and mandatum,
(Tit. 26. 10 supr.): cf. Gaius iii. 120, Dig. 4 8. 32. 3, and Bk. iv. 12.
1 inf., which is important for a large class of obligations arising ex
delicto· The operation of compensatio (set-off) is a matter of some
little difficulty: see on Bk. iv. 6. 30 inf. Confusio (p. 275 supr.) operated
in this way if the deceased’s heir was the sole debtor or sole creditor to
the obligation in question, because one of the prime requirements of an
ἡ obligatio, two personS, is no longer satisfied, Dig. 46. 3. 95. 2 ; but this
would be exemplified under Justinian only when the hereS‚ being debtor
or creditor of the deceased, did not make an inventory, see p. 277 supr.
Where the heir was one of two or more cor-real or solidary debtors or
creditors of the deceased it was otherwise: see Dig. 46. 1. 71. pr. cited
in Excursus VI 1. inf.
