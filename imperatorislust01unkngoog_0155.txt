pro iam natis habentur, et in hac causa placuit non minus
postumis quam iam natis testamento tutores dari posse, si
modo in ea causa sint, ut, si vivis parentibus nascerentur, sui

Qm DARI TUTORES TESTAMENTO PossUNT.

Dari autern potest tutor non solum pater familias, sed
etiam filius familias, Sed et servus proprius testamento 1
cum libertate recte tutor dari potest. sed sciendum est eum
et sine libertate tutorem datum tacite et libertatem directam

§4 Postumi liberi are children born after the execution of the will:
whether 'aster the death os the testator or in his lise-time is immaterial.
A paterfamilias could not give a testamentary guardian to a posthumous
grandson, is, supposing he had died immediately after the execution of
the will, the grandson would have been born in the *potestas of his own
father, the testator’s son : for in that case, the father being in the same
potestas, the child would not have been a suus heres to the testator.
Guardianship was only intended as a substitute for patria potestas, and
the existence of the latter barred the possibility of the former.

§ 5. There were five other cases in which magisterial confirmation of
a testamentary appointment was required, viz. (1) where a father gave
by will a guardian to his natural child, Dig. 26. 3. 7 3 (2) where the ap-
pointment was made in unconfirmed codicils or in an invalid will, Dig. ib.
ι. 1 ς (3) where the appointment violated the SC. Libonianum by being
written by the guardian himself ; here a ‘praevia inquisitio’ was neces-
sary, Dig. ib. 2. 29: 48. 1o. 18. 1 ; (4) where a mother attempted to
give a testamentary guardian to her child, the appointment would be
confirmed only ‘ex inquisitione,’ and only if the child were instituted
heir in the will, Dig. ib. 2. 43 (5) is a man appointed a testamentary
guardian to the child of some other person, the appointment would be
confirmed ex inquisitione is the child were instituted heir in the will, and
had no other property, Dig. ib. 3. 4. 5. In all these caseS, or at any rate
where an inquisitio was held, the appointment was deemed magisterial
rather than testamentary, Dig. ib. 2. 26. 2 : 48. ro. 18. ι.

mit. XIV. The two main rules os testamentary appointments are,
(1) there must be testamentifactio (Bk. ii. 19. 4 inf.) between testator
and the intended guardian, Dig. 26. 2. 21, and (2) the person must be
clearly specified‚ Bk. ii. 20. 27 inf.
