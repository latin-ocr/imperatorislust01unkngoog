Tit. ιι] DE ADOPTIONIBUS. 13 1

postea. Minorem natu non posse maiorem adoptare placet: 4
adoptio enim naturam imitatur et pro monstro est, ut maior
sit filius quam pater. debet itaque is, qui sibi per adro-
gationem -vel adoptionem filium facit, plena pubertate, id esf
decem et octo annis praecedere. Licet autern et in locum 5
nepotis vel neptis vel in locum pronepotis vel proneptis vel
deinceps adoptare, quamvis filium quis non habeat. Et tam 6
filium alienum quis in locum nepotis potest adoptare, quam
nepotem in locum filii. Sed si quis nepotis loeo adoptet vel 7
quasi ex eo filio, quem habet iam adoptatum, vel quasi ex
illo, quem naturalem in sua potestate habet: in eo casu et
filius consentire debet, ne ei invito suus heres adgnascatur.
sed ex contrario si avus ex filio nepotem dat in adoptior'ielm,
non est necesse filium consentire. In plurimis autem causis 8
adsimilatur is, qui adoptatus vel adrogatus est, ei qui ex

5. 19, Ulpian, reg. 8. 53 then it was permitted in special easeS, apparently
by imperial favour (Gaius i. 102), and eventually an epistola of Antoninus
Pius (Gaius ib.) allowed it generally, though only after inquiry held, and
under conditions : thus all the pupil's guardians had to sanction the act,
Cod. 5. 59. 5, and, as is mentioned in the text, the adrogator had to give
security for restoration of adrogatus' property to his next heirs (legitimi
or pupillariter substituti) if he died below puberty ; this limit being fixed
bemuse at that date the pupillary substitutions became void, and the
child, if he had not been adrogated‚ would have been able to make
a will for himself. The tabularius to whom security was given was a
servus publieuS, Dig. 1.·7 18, Cod. 8. 48. 2: cf. Gothofredus ad Cod.
Theod. 8. 2. 1, and Cod. 10. 69. 3. The fourth part of the adrogator’s
property, to which adrogatus became entitled under the circumstances
mentioned in the text, was called quarta Antonina or quarta divi Pii, and
the right to claim it seems to have been extinguished by the attainment
of puberty.

§ 4. The principle adoptio naturam imitatur, at least in this applica-
tion‚ was of comparatively late growth, for Gaius says (i. 106) ‘ sed et illa
quaestio, an minor natu maiorem natu adoptare possit, utriusque adop·
tionis commune est! Cicero (pro domo 13. 14) accuses Clodius os
having been adrogated by a person younger than himself, though in c. 13
he says it was done with the approval of the pontifices : cf. Suetonius,
Tib. 2. The doubt was settled by the time of Modestinus, who says that in
either form of adoption the adoptans must be older by at least eighteen
years, Dig. 1. 7. 40. 1. For the definition of this age as plena pubertas
cf. Paul. sent. rec. 3. 4. 2, Dig. 40. 2. 13: 35. 1. 101. 2.
