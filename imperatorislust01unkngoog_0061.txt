THE CLASSJCAL JURJSTS—JUS RESPONDENDI. 49

opportunity displayed itsels. Among the leading Sabinians may be
mentioned C. Cassius Longinus, who died under Vespasian, Caelius
Sabinus, Javolenus Priscus¹ (206), Salvius Julianus (457), who has been
already mentioned as the compiler of the Edictum perpetuum under
Hadrian, Sextus Pomponius (585), Sextus Caecilius Africanus(1 3 ι), and
finally Gaius (535), author of the Institutionum Commentarii quatuor,
the first book, so far as we know, bearing this title and intended for
elementary instruction, and also of Libri septem rerum quotidianarum
sive aureorum, and Commentaries on the Twelve Tables, the lex
Iulia and Papia, and the urban, provincial, and aedilician Edicta.
Labeo’s first two successors were M. Cocceius Nerva, mentioned in
Tacitus, Ann. vi. 26, and Sempronius Proculus (37), after whom this
school was called 'Proculian3 his principal followers were Pegasus,
praefectus urbi under Vespasian, the 'younger Juventius Celsus (142),
and Neratius Priscus (64), whom Trajan is said to have preferred to
Hadrian as his successor in the empire. After him on the one hand,
and Gaius on the other, we have no further traces of the controversy
between the schools. It would seem that a reaction had set in,
probably because differences os opinion which had once been ge⁰nuine
had now been degraded to mere hair splitting, or because the jurists
on both sides had become possessed with the spirit of Labeo, and
were beginning to revolt against the abuse of authority3 at least we
may infer from Gaius (iii. 98) that the pupils had taken to criticising
their masters· Bocking (Institutionen ξ 17) is of opinion that the
disappearance of the schools is sufficiently accounted for by the con-
dition of law and legislation in the age of the Antonines‚ and by the
establishment of public instruction in legal subjects, upon which more
will be said hereafter. However this may be, the subsequent jurists
took each his own line, tho‘ugh only the most famous os them need
be mentioned here. From Ulpius Marcellus, commander-in-chief in
Britain under Commodus, there are a hundred and fifty-nine excerpts
in the Digest3 Q. Cervidius Scaevola (307) was teacher of Papinian and
of the emperor Septimius Sevems3 besides these, Claudius Trypho-
, ninus (79), Venuleius Saturninus (71), Callistratus (29), Aelius Marci-
anus (275), and Florentinus (4 2), deserve notice. But the greatest
names are yet to come. Aemilius Papinianus was esteemed by all
his successore the greatest of Roman juristS. He commenced under
Marcus Aurelius (Α. n. 161-180) a political career which ended in his
