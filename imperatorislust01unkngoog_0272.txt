DE VULGARI SUBSTITUTIONE.

Potest autem quis in testamento suo plures gradus heredum
facere, ut puta ‘si ille heres non erit, ille heres esto:’ et
deinceps in quantum velit testator substituere potest et
novissimo loco in subsidium vel servum necessarium heredem

1 instituere. Et plures in unius locum possunt substitui, vel
unus in plurium, vel singuli singuliS, vel invicem ipsi qui
2 heredes instituti sunt. Et si ex disparibus partibus heredes
scriptos invicem substituerit et nullam mentionem in substi-

tutione habuerit partium, eas videtur partes in substitutione ·

dedisse, quas in institutione expressit: et ita divus Pius re-
3 scripsit. Sed si instituto heredi et coheredi suo substituto
dato alius substitutus fuerit, divi Severus et Antoninus sine
distinctione rescripserunt ad utramque partem substitutum

Tit. XV. Substitutions bear some resemblance to the remainders of
English law. They were dictated partly, no doubt, by the natural desire
to be succeeded by a number of persons, not collectively, but in sub-
ordination to one another 3 A (e. g.) being preferred to B, but if A could
or would not take the inheritance, then B being preferred to C, and so
on: but they were due still more, as is suggested by the concluding words
of the opening section‚ and as appears even more clearly from the next
Title, to the Roman dislike of intestacy. A substitution, as may be seen
from the form given in the text, is in effect a conditional institution:
conditional either on another and earlier named institutus not taking the
inheritance (Tit. 15), or, not only on this, but also on his taking and
dying before he is old enough to make a will sor himself (pupillary sub-
stitution, Tit. 16). The modes in which the condition might be fulfiued,
and the substitution take effect, were (1) the institutus dying before the
testator ε (2) his failing to comply with the testator‘s direction3‚ e. g. as
to the time within which he must accept ε or (3) his refusal to accept.

§ 1. When several joint instituti were reciprocally substituted each to
one another, any one of them who made aditio thereby also acquired his
share in the portion of any other who failed from any reason to take,
which he could not refuse ; and any one of them who refused to make
aditio as institutus could claim nothing as substitutus.

ς 3. This is expressed by the maxim substitutus substituto est sub-
stitutus institut0, which can be broken up into two quite different pro-
positions: (1) if B is substituted to A, and C to B, and B predeceases C,
the latter is entitled to A's share si heres non erit ε (2) if of two coheirs,
Α and B, B is substituted to A, and C, an extraneus, is substituted to B,
