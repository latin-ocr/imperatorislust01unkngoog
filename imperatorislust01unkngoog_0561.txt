Tit. 6.] DE ACTJONJBUS. 549

ecce si quis ita a te stipulatus sit ‘hominem Stichum aut
decem aureos dare spondes?’ deinde alterutrum petat, ve·-
luti hominem tantum aut decem tantum. ideo autern plus
petere intellegitur, quia in eo genere stipulationis promissoris
est electi0, utrum pecuniam an hominem solvere malit: qui
igitur pecuniam tantum vel hominem tantum sibi dari oportere
intendit, eripit electionem adversario et eo modo suam quidem
meliorem condicionem facit, adversarii vero sui deteriorem.
qua de causa talis in ea re prodita est acti0, ut quis intendat
hominem Stichum aut aureos decem sibi dari oportere, id est
ut eodem modo peteret, quo stipulatus est. praeterea si quis
generaliter hominem stipulatus sit et specialiter Stichum petat,
aut generaliter vinum stipulatus specialiter·Campanum petat,
aut generaliter purpuram stipulatus sit, deinde specialiter
Tyriam petat: plus petere intellegitur, quia electionem ad-
versario tollit, cui stipulationis iure liberum fuit aliud solvere,
quam quod peteretur. quin etiarn licet vilissimum sit quod
quis petat, nihilo minus plus petere intellegitur, quia saepe
accidit, ut promissori facilius sit illud solvere, quod maioris
pretii est. Sed haec quidem antea in usu fuerant: postea
autem lex Zenoniana et nostra rem coartavit. et si quidem
tempore plus fuerit petitum, quid statui oportet, Zenonis

praetor. Even aster the disappearance of formulae a plaintiff who made
an overclaim was punished with absolute loss of action on the ground
of calumnia, but this was remedied by the constitution of Zeno referred
to in the text, by which it was provided that though, if the plaintiff
brought his action prematurely (plus petitio tempore) he should pay the
defendant's costs hitherto incurred, and the latter be absolved, he might
sue again, but not until twice the interval had elapsed sor which he would
properly have had to wait (Tit. ζ 3. 10 infi), and during that interval
should have no claim to interest, Cod. 3. 10. 1. Justinian further enacted
that in plus petitio re the judge should condemn the defendant, so far
as he found him liable, and the plaintiff in three times the excess of sees
exacted from the other by the ‘ executor’ through the overclaim (ξ 24 supr.).
Plus petitio loco could no longer prejudice the defendant, because the
judge was bound to apply the principles of the actio de eo quod certo
lOCO, and either condemn the defendant to discharge his obligation at
the place agreed upon, or make allowance for the loss and inconvenience
he suffered by having to pay elsewhere3 and plus petitio causa was
equally harmless.
