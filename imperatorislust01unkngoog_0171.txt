modo finitur tutela morte vel tutorum vel pupillorum. Sed 4
et capitis deminutione tutoris, per quam libertas vel civitas
eius amittitur, omnis tutela perit. minima autem capitis
deminutione tutoriS, veluti si se in adoptionem dederit,
legitima tantum tutela perit, ceterae non pereunt: sed pupilli
et pupillae capitis deminutio licet minima sit, omnes tutelas
tollit. Praeterea qui ad certum tempus testamento dantur5
tutoreS, finito eo deponunt tutelam. Desinunt autem esse 6
tutoreS, qui vel removentur a tutela ob id quod suspecti visi
sunt, vel ex iusta causa sese excusant et onus administrandae
tutelae deponunt secundum ea quae inferius proponemus.

DE CURATomBUS.

Masculi puberes et feminae viripotentes usque ad vice-

tutela seems quite unreasonable) or have attempted to correct the pas-
sage so as to make it refer only to agnatic guardianship. An explanation
of this kind is given without any emendation by a scholiast, who inter-
prets the disputed words by saying τοῦτεστι τοῖς διαμείνασα ὖπεξουσίοις
μέχρι τῆς τοῦ πατρὸς τελευτῆς (hoc est, qui remanserunt in potestate usque

tutor, to be ‘ personae datus,’ and it is the auctoritatis interpositio which
forms the characteristic difference between the two: ‘si tutoris auctoritas
fixerit necessario . . . tutor ei necessario dabitur, quoniam curatoris auc·
toritas ad hoc inutilis est’ Dig. 49. 1. 17. 1. The exact scope of the
curator's administratio of course depended on the circumstances of the
case: sometimes he entirely managed the ward's property: sometimes
he allowed him practically to manage it himself, and here be took no
personal part in the busineSS, having no power to interpose auctoritas:
