DIVISION OF THE EMPJRE—-ITS EFFECTS ONLAW. 55

of all ‘ professors’ was the obligation of the praeses to assist thern in
recovering their honoraria by his extraordinaria cognitio (Dig. loc.

Under Constantine (ΑΛ). 306-337) the constitution lost its last sem-
blance of republican form, and assumed the character of an open
despotism. The most important results of this were a more rigid
concentration of all executive authority, separation of the civil and
military administratione, which had hitherto existed in close com-
bination, and the institution of a graduated official hierarchy, with a
consequent division of ranks and dignities. The distinctions of con-
dition rest either on an independent foundation or on the simple will
of the emperor. Of the first kind are the old contr-asts between cives,
Latini, and peregrlni, between ingenui and libertini, and between men
of unblemished civil reputation and infames3 also a new one be-
tween proprietors and non-proprietors of land. Of the second kind
are the patriciate, a new distinction devised by the emperors as a
reward for faithful service in the state or in the field, and the other
dignities of the court and of the civil and military administration,
dignitates palatinae, civiles, militares. All of these were arranged in
a fixed order of precedence, and differentiated from one another by
terms of honour such as illustris, spectabilis, clarissimus· It would
be tediouS, however, to enter into a full account of these, though more
or less connected with the subject of legislative power. Constantine’s
three sons, Constantine 11, Constantius, and Constans (sun. 336—361),
by their internal discords and the weakness of their efforts to sup-
press other pretenders to the throne, paved the way to the final
division of the empire into West and East, which took place under
Arcadius and Honorius, Α. n. 395. For some generations the two
empires subsisted side by side with one another. From the com-
mencement of the fifth century, however, the Germanic peoples began
to intrude themselves into the dominions of the Western Emperor,
and their aggressions became year by year more menacing, until,
aster having long been a mere object of booty to the barbarians, the
western empire was finally absorbed in their conquests mn. 476.

From this brief notice of the political history we turn to a more ap-
propriate subiect, the condition of the law in the period intervening
between Constantine and Justinian. Of the influences to which must
be attributed the general character and tendency of its development
one is intimately connected with the division of the empire into West
and East. The jurists had raised the ius gentium to a level with the
ius civile, and had esteemed naturalis as powersul a principle as civilis
