Tit. 3.] DE SERVJTUTJBUS. 207

tollat quis aedes suas, ne luminibus vicini officiatur. In rusti- 2
corum praediorum servitutes quidam computari recte putant
aquae haustum, pecoris ad aquam adpulsum, ius pascendi,
calcis coquendae, harenae fodiendae.

Ideo autem hae servitutes praediorum appellantur, quoniam 3
sine praediis constitui non possunt. nemo enim potest ser-
vitutem adquirere urbani vel rustici praedii, nisi qui habet
praedium, nec quisquam debere, nisi qui habet praedium. Si 4
quis velit vicino aliquod ius constituere, pactionibus atque

non avertendi, which seem to operate only in the way of freeing a
building from some pre-existing obligation. Mr. Poste (Gaius p. 179)
explains this by supposing that an urban servitude can be extinguished
only by the acquisition of a contrary servitude by the praedium serviens
But perhaps it is better to suppose that these anomalous servitudes
occurred only where the laws limited the rights of owners by forbidding
them to build above a certain height, compelling them to receive their
neighbours’ rainwater‚ ete. A law of Zeno of this nature, enacted origin-
ally for Constantinople only, was extended to all the cities of the empire
by Justinian (cod. 8. ιο. 12 and 13). If this is s0, it is difficult to con-
ceive the right in question as a servitude at all.

§ 2. The rights mentioned in this section are treated as rustic
servitudes by Neratius (Dig. 8. 3. 2 sq.), and by Papinian‚ Paulus, and
Ulpian. The word ‘ recte ' seems to imply that by some they were not
so considered, though there is no trace in the authorities of a difference
of opinion.

ξ 4. The old mode of constituting servitudes between the parties had
been in iure cessi0, Gaius ii. ²9· 30, rustic servitudes in Italy also ad-
mitting of creation by mancipatiO. These processeS‚ however, could be
employed only in respect of objects which could themselves be trans·
ferred in the same manner, so that (Gaius ii. 31) servitudes over praedia
provincialia, which were not ‘ in patrimoni0,’ could not thus be created.
In default, the occupiers of land in the provinces resorted to bare agree-
ments (pactio), subsequently expressed in a formal and solemn contract
(stipulatio), by which the owner of the land which was to be subjected
to the servitude bound himself to allow its enjoyment‚ or in default to
pay a penal sum, e. g. ‘per te non fieri neq-ue per heredem tuum, quo-
minus mihi heredique meo ire agere liceat; si adversus ea factum sit,
tantum dari’ Dig. 45. 1. 2. 5. Α right thus created could not in itself
avail in rem, or ‘ run with the land ;’ yet it seems clear from Gaius (ii.
31) that in his time such pactiones and stipulationes were as effectual to
create servitudes over provincial soil as in iure cessio and mancipatio
over praedia Italica. We must consequently suppose that the praetor had
intervened‚ and by the introduction of an utilis actio (consessoria) sor the
protection of the promise against all successors of the other in title had
given the right a genuine ‘ real ' character. In Justinian's time of course
