Tit. ῃ] DE TUTELJS. 141

prius dispiciamus de his quae in tutela sunt. Est auternl
tutela, ut Servius definivit, ius ac potestas in capite libero ad
tuendum eum, qui propter aetatem se defendere nequit, iure

auctoritas was not requisite for the validity of all dispositionS‚ and even
where it was he could not refuse it unless he were a patronus or parens
manumissor. The whole institution in fact had ceased to have any
significance, and the jux-ists themselves seem to have thought it an
absurdity: ‘feminas vero perfectae aetatis in tutela esse fere nulla
pretiosa ratio suasisse videtur: nam quae vulgo creditur, quia levitate
animi plerumque decipiuntur, et aequum erat eas tutorum auctoritate
regi, magis speciosa videtur quam vera ' Gaius i. 190. ‘lt is not, how-
ever, till aster Diocletian that guardianship of women entirely disap-
pears. cf. Mr. Poste's note on Gaius i. 189, and savigny, vermischte
Schriften i. 10.

ὃ 1. Though the power of the tutor was data ac permissa by the civil
law, tutela was not regarded by the Romans as an institution iuris
civilis: ‘impuberes autem in tutela esse naturali iure conveniens est, ut
is qui perfectae aetatis non sit, alterius tutela regatur ’ Tit. 20. 6 inf„
‘impuberes quidem in tutela esse omnium civitatium iure contingit ’
Gaius i. 189, the latter contrasting guardianship in this respect with
patria potestas. Mr. Poste, on the other hand, ascribes it to ius civile,
on the ground that no institution containing numerical definitions can
be supposed tp belong to natural law, if this is the less arbitrary element
of the positive code. But this does not show that the institution is not-
iuris gentium, but only that each state fills up voids in the ‘ natural
theory' by rules of its own, e. g. as to age, the persons who are to act,
their precise powerS‚ etc.

A guardian's responsibilities commenced immediately he was aware
that the office had been cast upon him: ‘ex quo innotuit tutori se
tutorem esse, scire debet periculum tutelae ad eum pertinere ² Dig.
26. 7. 5. 10, and if he had a valid excuse it had to be stated within the
time allowed by law, or else it was of no avail, Dig. ib. ι. 1. The main
purpose of the tutela impuberum, at least in the later Roman law, was
the supplementing of the ward's imperfect capacity of disposition, and
the guardian’s functions related to both his person, and his property.
He was responsible sor his maintenance and education, so far as his
means sufficed, unless exempted from this by special direction of the
appointing parent or magistrate. In relation to the property, his sphere
of action depended greatly on the pupil’s age. If he were infans (for
which see on Bk. iii. ¹9- 10 inf.) he was incapable of any act or dis-
position, and the tutor was said ‘ negotia pupilli gerere ’ and to have the
administratio, In this respect his freedom of action was largely cur·
tailed by imperial legislation: ‘imperatoris Severi oratione prohibiti
sunt tutores et curatores praedia rustica vel suburbana distrahere (sell) ’
Dig. 27. 9. 1. pr. Constantine extended the prohibition still further:
‘iam ergo venditio tutoris nulla sit nisi interpositione decreti, exceptis
