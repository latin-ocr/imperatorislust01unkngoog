aut hoc mense dari stipulatus sit, nisi omnibus partibus prae-
teritis anni vel mensis non recte petet. Si fundum dari 27·

gathered from ξ 27, the debtor could claim only so much grace as was
required by the very nature of the act to be performed : cf. Dig. 50. 17.
186. Nor, as a rule, was he entitled to receive a demand of performance
from the creditor, though he did not usually incur the penalties of mora
until such demand (interpellatio) had been made : ‘ mora fieri intellegitur
non ex re, sed ex persona, id est, si interpellatus opportuno loco non sol-
verit, quod apud iudicem examinabitur. Nam, ut Pomponius scripsit,
difficilis est huius rei definitio' Dig. 22. 1. 32. pr.: cf. Paul. sent. rec. 3.
8. 4. Such demand, however, was dispensed with (1) when a time was
fixed for performance in the sense that the debtor must perform them,
not merely that the creditor might not demand performance earlier.
This is the true Roman sense of the maxim ‘ dies interpellat pro homine,’
not that interpellatio was always unnecessary if a time for performance
was agreed upon, though it is stated that this interpretation has been almost
universally adopted in the practice of the modern civil law. (2) Where
the creditor was a minor, Dig. 31. 81. 7· (3) Where the obligation was
to give up property of which the creditor had been deprived by a delict,
Dig. 13. 1. 8. 1 ; ib. 203 Dig. 43. 16. 1. 34. Where demand was impos-
sible owing to the absence of the debtor or some other cause a declara-
tion might be made in lieu of it before a judge, Dig. 22. 2. 2.

The mere fact that a debtor has not performed what is due from him
does not, as a rule, affect his liability: it does so only in virtue of specific
provision in a contract or will (as where it is agreed that the promisor,
or directed that the heir, shall incur a penalty unless he performs within
a prescribed time) or by law (as where interest is due by statute). In
these exceptional cases the commentators speak of objective mora. But
any debtor or any creditor may become guilty of mora in the narrower
sense (so-called subjective mora) by conduct of his own : mora in that
sense being the wrongful refusal to perform an act, whether mora debi-
toris or solvendi, refusal to perform, or mora creditoris or accipiendi,
refusal to accept performance when due and properly tendered.

Mora debitoris exists only under the following conditions ε (1) the
debtor’s obligation must be valid and actionable, and he must not be able
to meet his creditor by any exceptio. (2) The time at which he was
bound to perform must have passed without performance. (3) He must
know that he is bound to perform at the time and in the manner required,
or (as Mr. Poste puts it) a further condition of mora is the absence of all
doubt and dispute, at least of all dispute that is not frivolous and vexa-
tiouS, as to the existence and amount of the debt: ‘qui sine dolo malo
ad iudicium provocat, non videtur moram facere ’ Dig. 50. 17. 63, ‘et hic
moram videtur facere, qui [d010, sc.] litigare maluit quam restituere ' Dig.
45. 1. 82. 1. (4) He must have no other ground of justification for his
default‚ this being a question for the court, ‘ esse enim hanc quaestionem
de bono et aequo' Dig. 45. 1. 91. 3 : e. g. impossibility (see on § 1 supr.).
Whether innocent insolvency was such a ground is disputed.
