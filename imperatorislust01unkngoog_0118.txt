actual, so that it is contrasted with mancipium, in servitute esse, and the
slavery of a prisoner of war; i.e. the rights of ingenuitas were not de-
stroyed by captivity, but could be recovered by postliminium ς Dig. 49.

The modes in which a slave could become free (and which are not
systematically discussed by Justinian, who confines himself in the main
to manumission) are three in number, viz. (1) postliminium, note on Tit.
12. 5 inf.; (2) manumission, of which below3 and (3) certain irregular
modes in which freedom was conferred by positive law without manu·
mission by the dominus (Dig. 40. 8 ‘ Qui sine manumissione ad liber-
tatem perveniunt'). Thus (a) the SC. Silanianum of Augustus’ period
liberated slaves who discovered their masters’ murderers, and the same
was done by later enactments as a reward for the detection of certain
other crimes, Cod. 7. 3. (β) An edict ·of Claudius gave liberty to slaves
exposed by their masters (see note on Tit. 3. 2 supr.). (γ) An enact—
ment of Vespasian did the same for ancillae who were exposed to pros-
titution against the terms of the disposition under which they were
acquired. (ἃ) If a slave were aliened under a promise to manumit,
which the alienee failed to perform, the slave was declared free by a law
of Marcus and Commodus. (c) A number of senatusconsulta beginning
under Trajan provide in the same manner for the enfranchisement of
slaves to whom liberty was bequeathed by a fideicommissum. (ζ) Cer-
tain less important modes introduced by Leo and Justinian are noticed
in Cod. 12. 5. 4, and Nov. 5. 2. 1 ς 123. 4. ¹7·

ξ 1. Manumission was an actos the master by which the slave became
free. Its effect, under the older law, was to make the slave not only free,
but a citizen of Rome3 indeed, he might even become a member of a
Roman family by being given in adoption to a paterfamilias by his
master, Gellius 5. 19, but under the later law this was not allowed. The
act was thus one of political import (see Mr. Poste on Gaius i. 17), and
therefore was required to be performed in some mode or other in which
the state, by participation, could give its sanction and consent.

Such ‘iustae ac legitimae manumissiones’ (Gaius i. 17) were three in
