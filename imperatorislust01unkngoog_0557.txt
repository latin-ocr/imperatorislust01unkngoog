terea quasdam actiones arbitrarias id est ex arbitrio iudicis
pendentes appellamus», in quibus nisi arbitrio iudicis is cum quo
agitur actori satisfaciat, veluti rem restituat vel exhibeat vel
solvat vel ex noxali causa servum dedat, condemnari debeat.
sed istae actiones tam in rem quam in personam inveniuntur.
in rem veluti Publiciana, Serviana de rebus coloni, quasi Ser·

vanaque certamina, cum res iam fuerit approbata, tunc ex altera parte,
quae iam paene convicta est, opponi compensationem iam certo et
indubitato debito, et moratoriis ambagibus spem condemnationis excludi .’
Though the expression ‘ aperto iure’ in the text above might seem to
imply that the counter claim must have been proved and established in
an independent action, it seems better to understand this passage to
mean that the proof and aestimatio of the counter claim must not be
so intricate as to practically reverse the respective rbles os the parties,
and as it were to turn the defendant into a plaintiff.

Great difficulty is occasioned by the expression ‘actiones ipso iure
minuant ³ in the text, and by the attribution even in juristic writings (e. g.
Dig. 16. 2. 43 ib. 10. pr.3 ib. 21) to compensatio of an operation ‘ipso
iure.' The standing opposition, in modes by which obligations were in-
validated, between invalidation ipso iure and invalidation ope exceptionis
(p. 448 supr.) has led some commentators to interpret these passages by
representing set-off as by itself (or ‘ sine facto hominis ’) absolutely
extinguishing the plaintiff's claim, so far as it goes 3 but if this were su,
such a tacit or automatic reduction of that claim would take place in all
cases where the defendant had a set-off, whether the latter wished it or
n0t3 a hypothesis which is sufficiently disproved by Dig. 27. 4. 1. 4
‘praeterea 'si tutelae iudicio quis convenietur, reputare potest id, quod in
rem pupilli impendit, sic erit arbitrii eius, utrum compensare, an petere
velit sumtuS,' and Dig. 16. 2. 7. 1 ‘ si rationem compensationis iudex non
habuerit, salva manet petitio! The real meaning of the expression seems
to be that, though the defendant, if he wishes to set-off against the
plaintifl‘, must plead his claim, yet, immediately he has pleaded and
proved it, its operation relates back to the moment at which the two
claims first coexisted: ‘si constat, pecuniam invicem deberi, ipso iure
pro soluto compensationem haberi oportet ex eo tempore, ex quo ab
utraque debetur, utique quoad concurrentes quantitates, eiusque solius,
quod amplius apud alterum est, usurae debentur, si modo earum petitio
subsistit’ Cod. 4. 31· 43 from that moment no interest can be claimed,
except on the balance, Cod. ib., Dig. 16. 2. 11 3 and if the defendant for-
gets to set-off, he can recover what he has paid in excess by condictio
indebiti, Dig. ib. ιο. 1 3 12. 6. 30. So far in fact as the two debts coex-
tended, each was extinguished: ‘dedisse intellegendus est etiam is, qui
compensavit’ Dig. 49. 14. 46. 5.
