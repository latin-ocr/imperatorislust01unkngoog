Tit. τι] DE SA TJSDA TIONJBUS3 571

Sed haec hodie aliter observantur. sive enim quis in rem 2
actione convenitur sive personali suo nomine, nullam satis-
dationem propter litis aestimationem dare compellitur, sed
pro sua tantum persona, quod iudicio permaneat usque ad
terminum litis, vel committitur suae promissioni cum iure-
iurand0, quam iuratoriam cautionem vocant, vel nudam pro-
missionem vel satisdationem pro qualitate personae suae dare
compellitur. Sin autem per procuratorem lis vel infertur vel 3
suscipitur, in actoris quidem persona, si non mandatum actis
insinuatum est vel praesens dominus litis in iudicio procura-
toris sui personam confirmaverit, ratam rem dominum habi-
turum satisdationem procurator dare compellitur: eodem ob-
servando et si tutor vel curator vel aliae tales personae, quae
alienarum rerum gubernationem receperunt, litem quibusdam
per alium inferunt. Sin vero aliquis convenitur, si quidem 4

ξ 2. Thus the engagement entered into in Justinian's time by a
defendant who appeared in person covered the ground of both (1) the
old vadimonium or cautio iudicio sisti, Gaius iv. 18 5, which secured the
appearance of the defendant in iure in cases of adjournment‚ and (2) the
clause de re defendenda of the security iudicatum solvi ; it bound him to
appear in court on the day of trial and defend the action : but he was no
longer required to guarantee satisfaction of the judgment. The ordinary
mode of enter-ing into this engagement was satisdatio; but even before
the time of Gaius the praetor had drawn distinctions in vadimonia, being
satisfied in some cases with a merely personal undertaking without
sureties (vadimonium purum), and in others with such undertaking
fortified by the oath or by a summary process for the recovery of the
recognisance (‘recuperatoribus suppositis’ Gaius iv. 685). Under Justinian
landowners (Dig. 2. 8. 15) and personae illustres (Cod. 12. 1. 17) could be
compelled to bind themselves in iudicio permanere usque ad terminum
litis only by a written cautio iuratoria ; it is not clear who were privileged
to give a bare promise to this effect, though the edict seems to have con-
tained careful regulations on the subject, Gaius loc. cit.: ‘pro tenore
generalium edictorum ² Cod. 12. 22. 8.

ξ 3. The general principle as to when a procurator who appears as
plaintifl' must give security ratam rem dominum habiturum is found in
Cod. 2. 13. 1 ‘cautio ratihabitionis tunc exigitur a procuratore, quotiens
incertum est an ei negotium mandatum est,’ cf. Dig. 3. 4. 6. 3 ‘si de
decreto dubitetur, puto interponendam et de rato cautionem.² The
agent was also exempted where his appointment was notified by letter to
the other party, note on Tit. 10. pr. supr„ or was evidenced by a libellus
addressed to the emperor, Dig. 46. 8. 21.

ξ 4. A procurator appointed in court (praesens) was thus in the same
