the subject are of opinion that it was merely a summat-y and provisional
machinery by which he was enabled to get actual possession of the
corporeal property belonging to the deceased’s universitas iuriS, his right
to the universitas itself being established by hereditatis petitio (direct or
possessoria, according as he was civil heir or not). The latter view seems
favoured by the text above, and to be conclusively proved by Dig. 43. 2.
2 ‘interdicto quorum bonorum debitores hereditarii non tenentur, sed
tantum corporum possessore5‚’ and Cod. 8. 2. 2 ‘ ergo iubemus, ut
omnibus frustrationibus amputatis per interdictum quorum bonorum in
petitorem corpora transferantur, secundaria actione proprietatis non
exclusa.’

No one could apply for the interdict, even though he were civil hereS,
(Gaius iii. 34), who had not by agnitio obtained bonorum possessio. On
application made by such person it would be directed against any one who
was in possession of corporeal property belonging to the inheritance
either pro herede or pro possessore. Possessores pro herede include
(besides persons ‘qui putant se heredes esse ') others who had made agnitio,
Dig. 5. 3. 1 1. pr. ; ib. 20. 13, or to whom the inheritance or part of it had
been transferred per fideicommissum ib. 13. 5-7, or who had bought the
inheritance in whole or part, or had so received it dotis causa, ib. 13. 4.
Possession pro possessore is defined in Dig. 5. 3. 11. 1 ‘pro possessore
vero possidet praedo, qui interrogatus, cur possideat, responsurus sit, quia
posside0, nec ullam causam possessionis possit dicere, et ideo fur et raptor
petitione hereditatis tenentur.’

'As appears from the text of the interdict cited above, any one could be
proceeded against by it who had fraudulently got rid of the possession of
res hereditariae, and even a completed usucapion would not protect the
possessor, the senatusconsult of Hadrian (Gaius ii. 57), which had been
passed primarily in the interests of civil heirs, having been extended also
to praetorian successorS. The grantee of the interdict would obtain
possession of the object in dispute on proving not only that he had
accepted the successim, but that no one else had a better right than he:
‘ quamvis bonorum possessionem agnovisti, non aliter possessor constitui
poteris quam si te defuncti filiurn esse probaveris' Cod. 8. 2. 1.

For the interdictum Salvianum cf. p. 534 supr. Its relation to the
actiones Serviana and hypothecaria seems identical with that of quorum
bonorum to hereditatis petitio 3 the plaintiff, alleging that he has a
hypothec over specific property of his debtor, which he fears may be
made away with before he can prove his right, obtains possession by the
interdict, and then proves his right by the action; ‘in Salviano inter-
dicte, si in fundum communem duorum pignora sint ab aliquo invecta,
possessor vincet, et erit iis descendendum ad Servianum iudicium ' Dig.
43. 33. 2. It would appear that the interdict lay not only against the
hypothecary debtor himself, but against any one who had possession of
the property subject to the hypothec : κατὰ παντὸς κατέχοντος τὰ τοῦ
