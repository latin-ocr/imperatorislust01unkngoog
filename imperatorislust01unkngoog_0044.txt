32 INTRODUCTION.

tury of the Republic it became very usual for the praetor to vary the
rules stated in his edictum perpetuum by subsidiary edicts issued
during his year of office. This violation of constitutional usage
menaced the stability of the law, and accordingly was made illegal
by a lex Cornelia (3.0. 67), ‘aliam deinde legem Corneliae, etsi nemo
repugnare ausus est, multis tamen invitis, tulit, ut praetores ex edictis
suis perpetuis ius dicerent. Quae res cunctam gratiam ambitiosis prae-
toribuS‚ qui varie ius dicere solebant, sustulit ’ (Asconius ad Cic. orat.
pro Corneli0, οἱ Dion Cassius xxxvi. ²3)-

The reference to Verres seems to make this a convenient place to
describe how the number of praetors was increased, and to point out
the bearing of this on the development of Roman law. As will be
shortly seen, the large number of foreigners who established them-
selves at Rome for commercial purposes led (Β. c. 247) to the ap-
pointment os a second praetor, called the praetor peregrinus, who
administered justice at Rome as between foreigners or foreigners and
citizens. This praetor also issued an edictum perpetuum consisting,
as will be seen, of rules drawn from what was known as the ius gen-
tium, a general law applicable to the Romans and to all people,
which became binding for Romans inter se by being imported steadily,
though gradually, from the edict of the praetor peregrinus into that of
the praetor urbanus. The former edict may thus be regarded as an
almost inexhaustible reservoir whence the praetor urbanus drew those
streams of ius naturale by which the civil law of Rome was expanded
and liberalised. When the territories of the state were extended
beyond the limits of Italy new praetors were made. Thus, two were
created, n.c. 227, for the administration of Sicily and Sardinia, and two
more were added when the Spanish provinces were formed, κιο. 197.
Sulla increased the number from six to eight, which Julius Caesar raised
successively to ten, twelve, fourteen, and sixteen. Many of these,
and also the consuls after their year of office, were entrusted with the
government of a province3 usually for a year, though the time was
often prolonged. Such governors‚ whether proconsule or propraetorS,
were invested with imperium and jurisdiction within the limits of
their respective provinces, and presided there as completely over the
administration of civil justice as did the praetor urbanus at Rome.
Accordingly, provincial governors naturally adopted the practice of
issuing, at the commencement of their term of office, an edictum
stating the rules and principles which they should observe in the ·
exercise of their jurisdiction. Hence arose a number of edicta pro·
vincialia, which we should have supposed consisted partly os rules
