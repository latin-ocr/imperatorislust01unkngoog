analogy of Theodosius Il’s prescription of actions, he enacted that thirty
years’ possession of property, moveable or immoveable, should confer
ownership, whether it admitted of the ordinary usucapio or n0, and even
in the absence of iustus titulus, Cod. 7. 39. This was called longissimi
temporis praescriptio.

§ 1. The mention of the runaway slave in this rather than in the next
section (‘ ancilla fugitiva sui furtum facere intellegitur’ Dig. 47. 2. 603 cf.
Cod. 6. 1. 1) is perhaps due to the senatus-consult (Dig’. 48. ις. 2) which
prohibited alienation of fugitivi, and so might be said in some sense to
have placed them in the category of res extra commercium.

ξ 2. The relation between the enactment of the Twelve Tables and the
lex Atinia (which apparently was passed about the middle of the second
century Rc.) seems to have been that the latter, while repeating the .·
prohibition of the former, added that the vitium furti should be purged
as soon as the object returned to the possession of the owner, Dig. 41:
3.4.6;50.16.215:seeon§3inf. ‚

The lex Plautia (ae. 59) and the lex Iulia (probably os Augustus)
were less stringent than the other two statutes. The latter had said
that stolen property should in no case be thus acquired, even by an
innocent holder for value (ξ 3) ; the former merely excluded the violent
dispossessor himself, and not his innocent transferes or other person.
They related practically to land only, for this did not come within the
operation of the Twelve Tables and lex Atinia, see on ξ 7 inf.

ξ 8. The vitium furti was purged, and the thing recovered the capacity
os being acquired by usucapiO, by returning into the hands of its owner
(ξ 8 inf.; cf. Bk. iv. 1. 12) or of his agent to his knowledge. Hence if
a man steals his own property (e. g. from a usufructuary or bona fide
