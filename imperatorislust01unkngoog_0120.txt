adeo ut vel in transitu manumittantur, veluti cum praetor
aut proconsul aut praeses in balneum vel in theatrum eat.

3 Libertinorum autem status tripertitus antea fuerat:‚ nam
qui manumittebantur, modo maiorem et iustam libertatem
consequebantur et fiebant cives Romani, modo minorem et
Latini ex lege Iunia Norbana fiebant, modo inferiorem et
fiebant ex lege Aelia Sentia dediticiorum numero. sed
dediticiorum quidem pessima condicio iam ex multis tem-
poribus in desuetudinem abiit, Latinorum vero nomen non
frequentabatur: ideoque nostra pietas omnia augere et in
meliorem statum reducere desiderans in duabus constitutio-
nibus hoc emendavit et in pristinum statum reduxit, quia et
a primis urbis Romae cunabulis una atque simplex libertas
competebat, id est eadem, quarn habebat manumissor, nisi
quod scilicet libertinus fit qui manumittitur, licet manumissor
ingenuus sit. et dediticios quidem per constitutionem ex-

The right of the suu owner to manumit was originally subject to no
restrictionS, except so far as he was bound by any contract or testa-
mentary disposition under which the slave came into his possession.
Subsequently, however, limitations were imposed, in the main on poli·
tical groundS, by the lex Aelia Sentia, Α. D. 4, § 4 ins. and Tit. 6. pn, and
the lex Fufia Caninia‚ Tit. 7 inf„ and by the lex Iulia de adulteriiS, Bk.
iv. 18. 4 inf„ in order to assist the conduct of criminal proceedingS.

Until Justinian abolished the distinction between Bonitary and Quiri-
tary ownership (note on Bk. ii. 1. 11 inf.) a slave might belong to one
person ex iure Quiritium, and be ‘in bonis ' os another ; the latter alone
could manumit him, but only so as to make him a Latinus Iunianus3
Ulpian, reg. 1. 16. Where one person had a usufruct in a slave belong-
ing to another, any attempt by the former to manumit him merely resulted
in the extinction of his usufruct ς he could be manumitted by the owner,
who, however, could not thus prejudice the right of the usufructuary3
Ulpian, ib. 19: Justinian (Cod. 7. 15. 1) made some alteration in this.
The same principles were observed in respect os a slave who had been
given in security by pledge ; but the manumission of any slave in whom
another person had a ius in re aliena made him Latinus only and not

of a slave owned by joint proprietors see Bk. ii. 7. 4 and note inf.
