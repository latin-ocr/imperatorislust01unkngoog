Tit. 13.] DE EX HEREDA TIONE LIBERORUM. 247

nominatim eas personas exheredare parentibus necesse er'at,
sed licebat et inter ceteros hoc facere.

Nominatim autem exheredari quis videtur, sive ita exhere- 1
detur ‘ Titius filius meus exheres esto,' sive ita ‘ filius meus

form given in this section- As regards all sui and suae except sons, the
civil law was satisfied if, in default of institution, they were disinherited
by a general clause (⁴ ceteri exheredes sunto ³ Gaius ii. 128, which, if Jus-
tinian in Cod. 6. 28. 4 is to be believed, would originally be enough for
sons as well). The civil law effect of pretermitting these was not (as in
-the mse of a son) to avoid the will, but merely to entitle them to a share in
the succession varying with the character of the instituted heir or heirS.
If these were sui, the praeteriti took share and share alike with them
(adcrescunt in virilem portionem) 3 if extranei (Tit. 19. 3 inf.) they were
entitled to half the inheritance 3 for illustrations see Gaius ii. 124. An ex-
traneus, however, who was instituted heir in a will in which such persons
were praeteriti, was more hardly treated by the praetor, who gave the
praeteriti bonorum possessio (contra tabulas) of the whole, ‘ qua ratione
extranei heredes a tota hereditate repelluntur ’ Gaius ii. 12 5 3 but a re·
script of M. Aurelius again curtailed the rights of suae praeteritae by
enacting that they should in no case take more by bonorum possessio
contra tabulas than they would have taken by the ius adcrescendi of the
civil law (ib. 126) 3 the effect of this was to augment the rights of pre-
termitted sui not in the first degree (e. g. grandsons).

The praetor, not satisfied with the >civil law rules of exheredation in
respect of persons in the testator’s power, required all sui-grandsons,
greatgrandsons, ete, no less than sons, to be disinherited nominatim, pro-
mising them in default bonorum possessio contra tabulas (Gaius ii. 129) 3
according to which, though the will remained formally valid‚ the inherit-
ance was divided among all the sui, whether instituted or pretermitted,
as under the rules of intestacy, Digr 37. 4. 11. 1, ib. 8. 4. To summarise
what has been said—unless instituted

(1) Sui filii must be disinherited nominatim 3 else the will is void, and
the man dies intestate.

(2) Other sui may (a) iure civili be disinherited inter ceteros; in de-
sault‚ they are entitled either to the ius adcrescendi or to half the inherit·
unce 3 (b) iure praetorio, they must be disinherited nominatim 3 in defluit,
if the institutus is extraneus, they can get bonorum possessio of the whole 3
as against instituted sui they are entitled to have the bona distributed
‘tanquam intestatus decessisset)

(3) Suae of whatever grade may be disinherited hya general clause 2.
in default (a) iure civili, the will is not void, but they are entitled to
the ius adcrescendi 3 (b) iure praetorio, they could claim bonorum pos-
sessio of the whole against an extraneus heres until the rescript of
M. Aurelius, when the older law (by which they got hals) was in effect
restored. e
