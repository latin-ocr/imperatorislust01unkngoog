SENA T US CONSUL TA—IMPERIAL LE GJSLA TION. 41

of urgent public necessity, guarding the privileges of the aerarium
and the publicani, and superintending the treatment os the Italians
and provincials ; upon all os which matters it was in the habit of
making consulta to which it required general obedience. Its legisla-
tion was thus at first confined to public matters3 the earliest senatus
consultum which we know is that de Bacchanalibus (n c. 186), dis-
covered on bronze in Calabria in 1640. But the party of the optimates
had regarded the senate as the fundamental element of the state, of
co·ordinate authority with the populuS, and had therefore maintained
that its resolutioris ought in all cases to have equal validity with leges;
thus Cicero enumerates senatus consulta among the sources of ius
civile, and says of the senate (de Leg. iii. 3. 12) ‘ eius decreta rata
sunto! The claim was constantly resisted by the populares. though
supported by usage 3 nevertheless the senatorial legislation by degrees
extended itsels to matters of private law, though but little os it relating
to this is found in the 'pre-imperial period. That senatus consulta
under the early empire gradually superseded legeS,is attributed by Jus-
tinian aster Pomponius (Dig. 1. 2. 2) to the extension of the suffrage,
and the consequent unwieldiness of the comitia: ‘ Nam cum auctus
esset populus Romanus in eum modum ut difficile esset in unum eum
convocari legis sanciendae causa, aequum visum est senatum vice
populi consuli ' (Inst. i. a. 5). Under AugustuS, and still more under
his successors, it became so usual to⁴ ascribe the force of law to senatus
consulta without sending them on to the comitia, that at length they
actually acquired the title of leges (e. g. Gaius i. 83-86) ;. similarly, the
name comitia was commonly given to the sittings of the senate
(Tacitus, Ann. i. 15, Capitol. Marc. ιο). The transference of legisla-
tive authority from populus to senate is indicated by the practice of
naming senatus consulta, like legeS, after their proposers3 but this
was not invariable: sor instance, the SC. Macedonianum seems from
Dig. 14. 6. 1 to have received its title from an unscrupulous usurer
called Macedo, though Theophilus says that Macedo was the bor-
rower. Most os the senatus consulta relating to private law fall
between Claudius (ΑΛ). 4¹) and Septimius Severus (mn. 193—211);
none occur aster the last-named emperor. Like leges in this period,
they always owed their introduction to the imperial will, though usually
proposed by a consu13 in effect, they were laws made by the emperor,
though under observance of republican forma.

The emperor, however, possessed the right os making laws directly,
without reference to either senate or comitia. This right had not be·
longed to Augustus and his immediate successors; as magistrates of
