DE USU FRUCTU.

Usus fructus est ius alienis rebus utendi fruendi salva rerum
substantia. est enim ius in corpore: quo sublato et ipsum
tolli necesse est. Usus fructus a proprietate separationem 1
recipit idque plurimis modis accidit. ut ecce si quis alicui
usum fructum legaverit: nam heres nudam habet proprietatem,
legatarius usum fructum: et contra si fundum legaverit de-
ducto usu fructu, legatarius nudam habet proprietatem, heres
v'ero usum fructum: item alii usum fructum, alii deducto eo
fundum legare potest. sine testamento vero si quis velit alii
usum fructum constituere, pactionibus et stipulationibus id
efficere debet. ne tamen in universum inutiles essent pro·
prietates semper abscedente usu fructu, placuit certis modis
extingui usum fructum et ad proprietatem reverti. Constituitur 2
autem usus fructus non tantum in fundo et aedibus, verum

etiam in servis et iumentis ceterisque rebus exceptis his quae

mit. IV. Ususruct is distinguished from usus by its greater orbit‚ the
usufructuarius being entitled ‘frui' as well as ‘ uti! The differentia of·
the right thus lies in the word fructus, for which see Tit. 1. 37 supr.
Subject to the obligation not to abuse or misuse (⁶ recte enim colere debet,
et quasi bonus paterfamilias ’ ib. 38), and in the absence of express pro-
vision to the contrary, the holder of the right may take all fruits of the
object, civil as well as natural ; and where it is land, he may ordinarily
dig for minera15‚ but not to such an extent as· to violate the rule ‘boni
viri arbitratu uti frui debet, causam proprietatis deteriorem facere non
debet.' His general obligations in this respect are contained in the ex-
pression ‘salva rerum substantia,’ sor which see Ulpian, reg. 24. 26
‘earum rerum, quarum salva substantia utendi fruendi potest esse
facultas ε’ he may not use the object over which histright exists for pur-
poses clearly other than those for which it was designed‚ Dig. 7. 1. 13. 8 ;
ib. 15. 1, nor may he change its character, and he must restore it in as
good condition as that in which he received it. Where the right was
given testamento, the discharge of these obligations was secured by
a cautio usufructuaria, or personal undertaking guaranteed by sureties z
subsequently the dominus was held entitled to demand it in nearly all
cases.
