THE GENERAL ΝΑ TURE OF OBLIGA T IONS. 46 5

tions only, which, if the inferior had a peculium, discharged them·
selves by their operation on the latter, which was automatically
diminished by what he owed the superior, and 'augmented by what
the superior owed him, Dig. 15. 1. 9. 2-4.

In Bk. iii. 29 there is a discussion os the modes in which obliga-
tions could be extinguished: but this seems the most convenient
place for briefly describing those in which they could be trans·
ferred. To this question there are two sides; either the right ⁵
may be transferred, or the liability. Transference of the liability‚ if
by that we understand a transaction which entirely releases the
person who has hitherto been liable, and imposes the debt on some
one else, could (apart from universal succession) be effected only by
novatio (Bk. iii. 29. 3), which, when employed for this specific pur-
pose, was called expromissiO, or by an act os a similar character,
defensio. Transference of the right also (except in cases of uni-
versal succession) could at first be effected only by novatio, This,
however, is not assignarent, but substituted agreement 3 the assent
and co·operation of the debtor is required, and the right does not
pass from the person entitled to some one else, but is cancelled on
condition of a new one being created in favour of the latter. The
Romans, in fact, struggled, with a tenacity equalled only by that of
the English Common Law, against the assignment of what we call
choses in action, i. e. rights in personam3 but while the reason
alleged for his resistance by the English judge was the evil of
‘ maintenance‚’ the RomanS, with more lawyer-like instinct, based
their opposition on the character of an obligation as an essentially
personat relation, the parties to which could not be changed without
destroying its existence ¹.

A rude species of assignrnent became possible after the introduc·
tion os the formulary procedure, under which plaintiffs were generally
permitted to conduct their suits through agents (Gaius iv. 82). If
A, creditor against B, debitor, wished to assign his right to C, he
could make the latter his agent, procurator (in rem suam), C thereby
became entitled to accept performance from B, or in default to sue
him in A’s name, the condemnation being expressed in his own
name (Gaius iv. 86, 87). The result, in the Roman view, was no
transference of the obligation, for A remained the true and only
creditor ,· all that passed was the right of action, or rather the capacity
to exercise another’s right of action, and all that C asserted or
