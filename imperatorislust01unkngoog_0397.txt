Tit.14.] QUIBUS MODIS RE CONTRAHJTUR OBLIGATIO. 385

id imputare debet. Creditor quoque qui pignus accepit re 4
obligatur, qui et ipse de ea ipsa re quam accepit restituenda
tenetur actione pigneraticia. sed quia pignus utriusque gratia
datur, et debitoris, quo magis ei pecunia crederetur, et credi-
toris, quo magis ei in tuto sit creditum, placuit sufficere, quod
ad eam rem custodiendam exactam diligentiam adhiberet:

the intention of the parties: a mutuum is given in the interest of the bor·
rower‚ or, is payment of interest be stipulated for, in that of both parties ε
a deposit of this kind is made in the interest os the depositor only : and
the difference was material, for by the actio depositi, which was bonae
fidei, interest was recoverable, whether due by agreement or on account
of mora. The commonest illustration of the contract is to be found in
banking3 if money were deposited unsecured by key, seal, or other fast-
ening, it was presumed to be a depositum irregulare: ‘ . . . . idem iuris
esse in deposito: nam si quis pecuniam numeratam ita deposuisset, ut
neque clausam neque obsignatam traderet, sed adnumeraret, nihil aliud
eum debere, apud quem deposita esset, nisi tantundem pecuniae solvere ’
Dig. 19. 2. 31. .

ξ 4. As a source of real rights, pignus has been already discussed‚ p.
316 sq. supr. Justinian's requirement of exacta diligentia in the pledgee,
though irreconcileable with Gaius in Dig. ¹3· 6. 18. pr. (where only that ⁵
qualem in suis rebuS‚ etc. is exacted)‚ is confirmed by Ulpian and Paulus
in Dig. 13. 7. 13. 1 ; ib. 14. Some difficulty is occasioned by the word
‘sufficere ;’ possibly the jurist (perhaps Gaius) from whom the text was
derived, after describing commodatum, and saying that the borrower was
answerable for exacta diligentia, went on ‘in pledge, on the other hand,
it is sufficient that the pledgee should be as careful as in suis rebus ;'
and the compilers of the Institutes, while altering the degree of diligentia
to agree with Ulpian and Paulus, omitted to alter sufficere into some such
word as requiri (Schrader).

The chief other duties of the pledgee were (1) to return the property
pledged when the debt was paid, or the ius pignoris otherwise deter-
mined. The general rule too is that he must either give up to the
pledgor all the fruits or other profit derived from the property, or deduct
their value from the amount of the debt, Dig. 13. 7. 22. pr. ι but on this
point there was osten some special agreement, e. g. antichresis. (2) tf he
exercised the n'ght os sale, he was bound to hand over to the pledgor only
what remained after discharging the principal debt with interest, unless
by his own fault he sold it for less than its real value ε in which case he
was liable to pay the difference himself.

The possible duties to which the pledgor might become liable ex post
facto correspond to those which have been noticed under commodatum ε
he was also bound (1) to discharge all debts which the pledgee might
incur in his efforts to sell the property at the highest possible price,
Dig. ¹3· 7. 22. 43 (2) to deliver it up when required for sale, if it had
