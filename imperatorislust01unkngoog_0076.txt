1. 17. 2. η). It had thus become extremely necessary that these
should be multiplied, and als0, if possible, recast in a more convenient
form, which should enable such alterations to be made in the substan-
tive law as circumstances demanded, and also secure the incorporation
in the main work of the detached constitutions which had been pub·
lished since the code os Theodosius. Theodosius had himself con-
ceived the design of combining the writings of the authorized jurists
and the imperial legislation (which had now been long contrasted
under the terms ius and leges) in one comprehensive statute book3
but the idea of combination had produced no resultS, and of that
emperor's two great reforms the one related to iuS, the other to leges
only. When Justinian had resolved on his great scheme of giving a
new form to the Roman law, the enormous mass of the material and
the convenience os dividing the labour of codification caused him to
prefer the retention of the two elements of the ius scriptum in separa·
tion. He also hesitated whether to retain them in their existing shape,
subject of course to such alterations as were called for by the neces·

, sity of harmonising them inter se, and with the law as at present

administered, or, while preserving their tenor and substance, to com-
pletely alter their literary form ; he tells us that a regard for the past,
and admiration for the services which the jurists and his imperial pre-
decessors had rendered to jurisprudence‚ had decided him in favour
of the former alternative.

The codification of the imperial legislation, as having been in part
already executed‚ presented the least difficulty; its claim was also the
more pressing, because all imperial officers were requir‘ed by law to
possess copies of the existing codices This task was accordingly
first taken in hand. In A. n. 528 Justinian appointed a commission
for the purpose of ten persons, among them being Tribonian, who
played so important a part in the legislative work of the next few
’ years, and who not improbably suggested to his master his whole
scheme of legal reform. The work with which they were entrusted

was to form a single code out of the codices Gregorianus‚ Hermoge-
nianuS, and Theodosianus, and the constitutions issued since Aa). 439 3
omitting all that was superfluouS, reconciling such enactments as were
inconsistent with one another, and, where convenience required, com-
bining several into one (‘ colligentes vero in unam sanctionem, quae

individual constitutions which they should deem necessary (‘ adiicientes
