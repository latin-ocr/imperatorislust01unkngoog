rape of the Sabine women, and is expressly stated by Festus, who
ascribes the custom to Romulus' success in thus providing himself
with a wife. Even the gods were supposed to get their earthly minis·
ters in much the same unceremonious manner ; the vestal virgin, says
Gellius (i. 12. ξ 13) ‘pontificis maximi manu prehensa ab eo parente
in cuius potestate est veluti bello capta-abducitur.’ The spear was the
oldest symbol of right 3 hence there was no stronger title than pur-
chase ‘ sub hasta‚’ at a sale held by state authority ; it was planted in
the ground in the centumviral court, which had a special jurisdiction
in questions of ownership: it appeared in the vindicatio or real action,
and its use in manumission per vindictam will occur to every reader.
Property in land was never called anything by the Romans but prae-
dium; the analogy with praeda, ‘booty,' suggests itself at once, and
has been noticed by early writerS, one of whom remarks ‘ antiqui
agros quos bello ceperant ut praedae nomine habebant) Again, the
term manuS, meaning primarily ‘hand,' and derivatively ‘power,' ‘force,’
‘controL' plays an extremely prominent part in early legal phraseology.
Perhaps its frequency in procedure (e. g. manum conserere, manus
iniectio) is due to the survival in judicial institutions of traces osan
. older system, namely, violent sels-redtess of wrong 3 but Sir H. Maine
has observed (Ancient Law p. 317) that there is very strong reason
sor believing that manus was the ancient general term expressing
power, whether exercised over flockS, herds‚ slaves, children, or wife:
and there is an affinity between heruS, ‘owner,' and the Greek χείρ,
through the Sanskrit hr, which has the same meaning as the Latin
root cap. On the other hand, while to denote man the Sanskrit and
Greek agree (nri, nara, ἀνήρ), the Romans have discarded the corre-
sponding word, and use ‘vir,’ which in Sanskrit means ⁴ warriore’ they
name him not from his sex, but from his calling and occupation:
‘ virtue ' is conceived first and foremost as valour in war, only later as
purity and honesty. The very name in which the Romans delighted,
and which their satirists cast in their teeth—Quirites—may be taken
as a final illustration: Quiris or Curis in old Sabine is equivalent to
hasta 3 Quirites are ‘spearmen :' and thus we see how dominium ex
iure Quiritium has a deeper meaning, as carrying us back to the
prehistoric time when the strong man armed could alone possess his
goods in peace.

In such a social condition the only mode in which a man who
conceived himself wronged by another could· obtain satisfaction was
by taking the law, as it is said, into his own hands. A system of
sels-redtesS, in the form of private vengeance, preceded everywhere
