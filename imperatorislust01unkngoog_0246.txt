uno ictu to another, or others viewed collectively. Four such modes
are here enumerated, but far the most important of them are hereditas
and bonorum possessio, which are treated together and practically form
a single institution. Their problem is this :—When a man dies, what
becomes os his property, and who, is any one, becomes answerable for
his liabilities?

According to the Roman view, as soon as a man died his proprietary

relations assumed a separate, independent, and‘ collective existence: his
universitas iuris became specifically an hereditas, belonging, in many
cases, as yet to no one, and as it were perpetuating the existence of the
deceased: ‘res hereditariae, antequam aliquis heres existat, nullius in
bonis sunt’ Dig. 1. 8. 1. pr. It became, in fact, a juristic person, as capable,
in many respectS, of acquiring rights and incurring liabilities as a natural
person ε ‘ hereditas non heredis personam sed defuncti sustinet, ut multis
argumentis iuris civilis probandum est' Dig. 41. 1. 33. 2, ‘mortuo reo
promittendi et ante aditam hereditatem fideiussor accipi potest, quia
hereditas personae vice fungitur, sicuti municipium et decuria et societas’
Dig. 46. 1. 22.
· There is no precise resemblance between the Roman heres and the
English heir. The latter is the person who succeeds to such real property
os a deceased person as he has not disposed of by will : the former was
the person who succeeded to the universitas iuris of a deceased, whether
under a will or an intestacy: and succeeding as he did to, the universitas
iuriS, there was necessarily no more distinction between realty and per·
sonalty than between rights and liabilities.

Until the hereditas had vested in an heir or heirs, and so lost its inde-
pendent existence, it remained a persona under the name ol* hereditas
iacens. In the heir or heim, taken collectively, it can vest only as a
whole ε until it has so vested, the rights and liabilities os which it consists
are inseparable. Where there is no will, this is not difficult to realise
even to a mind habituated to the English distinction between realty and
personalty: but even where there was a will, the testator could not begin
by saying ‘I bequeath so and so toA ε’ he must first give it to the heir
or heirs, as a part of the agg-regate universitas„ and charge them to give
it to the intended legatee. Universality of succession is thus the prime
characteristic of the Roman law of inheritance: ‘ nihil est aliud hereditas,
quam successio in universum iuS, quod defunctus habuit ’ Dig. 50. 16. 24.

The answer to the question, to whom the hereditas belongS, or who
is entitled to become hereS, depends upon the further question, whether
the deceased has left behind him a valid testament. There is reason
to believe that at one time wills were unknown in Roman law: that
when a man died, his universitas iuris devolved on a person or persons
by rules rigidly prescribed by law, which he had no power to alter or
override. But the testamentary power, when once admitted, was very
generally exercised: which will perhaps account for its being treated first
