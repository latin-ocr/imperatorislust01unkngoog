liberis multae differentiae sunt. aut enim ingenui sunt aut
libertini.

between absolute slavery and complete legal freedom there were two inter-
mediate conditions. The first of these is that of the statu liber (⁴ qui
statutam et destinatam in tempus vel conditionem libertatem habet ’ Dig.
40. 7. 1. pr.) 3 the other is that of the slave who was said ‘ in libertate esse‚’
i. e. who was manumitted in some mode not recognised as conferring full
legal freedom (note on Tit. 5. 1 infi), and who therefore remained a slave
in the eye of the laW, though protected by the magistrate in the actual
enjoyment of liberty.

From these cases differ certain others in which a person, though
actually free, was subject to an external control which limited his freedom,
and placed him to a considerable degree in the position os a slave : (ι) the
free person bona fide serviens, i.e. who thinks he is a slave ; in some
matterS, especially with regard to acquisition, he was treated as a slave,
and all that he acquired under definite conditions belonged to his quasi
dominus ; see Bk. ii. 9. 4 infi, Gaius ii. 92· (2) The auctoratus, who hired
himself out as a gladiator, Gaius iii. 1993 the hirer could sue by actio
furti if he were removed from his control. The gladiatorial fights were
prohibited by Constantine, Cod. 11. 43. 1. (3) 1f a prisoner of war was
redeemed‚ his owner had a kind os lien on him until the whole redemption
sum was paid, and so long the ius postliminii was suspended. (4) The
debitor addictus under the middle law of bankruptcy did not become his
creditor's slave, but was bound to work for him until the debt was satisfied3
see Gaius iii. ¹99 sor a parallel between him and the auctoratus. (5) The
free person in mancipio, for which see note on Tit. 8. pr. inf. (6) The
colonus. Coloni (in this sense) were persons inseparably attached srorn
birth to the soil of some particular estate or district (glebae adscripti) for
purposes of cultivation 3 they were personally free, but as it were slaves
of the land, ‘ licet conditione videantur ingenui servi tamen terrae ipsius
cui nati sunt existimentur’ eod. 11. 51. 1 3 under the later Empire they
composed the greater part of the agricultural population. In many
respects they were completely assimilated to slaves ς thus their property
was called peculium, and was considered, like themselves, an appendage
of the soil, and if they ran away they could be recovered by real action :
sor a longer notice of them see Mr. Poste’s note on Gaius iii. 146. One
theory of the origin of colonatus is that it is to be traced to the Roman
practice of distinguishing between town and country slaves (familia
urbana and rustica) ς the latter, being engaged in tillage, seem always
to have enjoyed a certain freedom of action, and. came more and more
to be regarded as accessions to the land; their position was actually
much the same as that of the colonus, except that the status of the
latter was a legal one, and it is urged that the transition from the un-
free to the free condition perhaps resulted from some statute empower·
ing domini to manumit rural slaves on condition of their remaining
glebae adscripti and paying a substantia] rent (canon) for their hold·
ings. Other writers on the subject however, among them Savigny,
