ORIGIN ΛΝΒ DE VELOPMENT OF BON. POSSESSIO. 459

possessio obtained under a praetorian will3 in other words, the· latter
was sine re. ’ ,

Savigny connects the praetorian system os succession, in origin,
with the old usucapio pro herede (Gaius ii. 52-56) which the civil
law regarded with approval (‘ quod voluerunt veteres maturius heredi-
tates adiri, ut essent qui sacra facerent, quorum illis temporibus
summa observatio fuit, et ut creditores haberent, a quo suum con-
sequerentur ’ ib. 55) and of which the praetor laid hold as the starting-
point of his innovations; he gave the possession to certain persons
who, it was admitted, had an equitable, though not a leg-al, right to the
estate, and devised, in the interdict quorum bonorum, a remedy by
which they could recover the deceased’s property from other pos-
sessors, thus placing them in a position to become owners by usu-
capi03 the practical assimilation of the bonorum possessor to the
heresi, and the introduction of the possessoris hereditatis petitiO,
being due to the identification of bona fide possession with boni-
tarian ownership. Others (e. g. Hugo) think bonorum possessio was
based, in all essential point8‚ on the ius gentium, and was in origin
the system applied in the succession to aliens by the praetor pere-
grinus, from whose edict it was gradually transferred to the edictum
urbanum. This, though a priori an attractive theory, seems untenable
on account of the tenderness which the praetor almost ostentatiously
showed for the civil law and the agnatic conception of kinship; a
gentile system of inheritance would have been based solely on cogna-
tion. Niebuhr connects bonorum possessio with the possessio os ager
publicus (p. 326 supr.), with the succession to which alone he thinks
it was originally concerned; but this, as has been remarked, is
irreconcileable with the very name bonorum possessio, and improbable
on general grounds.
