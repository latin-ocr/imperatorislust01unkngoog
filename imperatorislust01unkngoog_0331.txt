JURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES. 319

favour of many classen of persons: e. g. of a wife, or other person
‘who gave a dos, over the property of her husband, to secure its
return, and of pupils over that of their guardians. So too the land-
lord of a house had a tacit hypothec over things ‘invecta and illata:
as security sor his rent: ‘ eo iure utimur, ut quae in praedia urbana
inducta illata sunt, pignori esse credantur, quasi id tacite convenerit:
in rusticis praediis contra observatur' Dig. 20. 2. 4. pr. z and the leesor
of agricultural land had the same implied right over the crops: ‘ in
praediis rusticis fructus, qui ibi nascuntur, tacite intelleguntur pignori
esse domino fundi locati, etsi nominatim id non convenerit’ Dig. ib.
7. pr. Lastly should be noticed the new power of pledging the same
property to several persons in succession, though to do this without
notice to prior pledgees rendered the debtor liable to a charge of
stellionatus, Dig. 13. 7. 37. 1. Hence, t00, questions of collision and
priority among competing pledgeeS, which occupy so large a space
in modern Roman law: a subject, however, too wide to be touched
upon here.

One result os the general use of hypotheca was the extension of its
rules and remedies to pignus. In the time of Ulpian the right of sale
had become an essential and inherent part os every pignus: ⁸ etsi non
,convenerit de distrahendo pignore, hoc tamen iure utimur, ut liceat
distrahere, si modo non convenit ne liceat. Ubi vero convenit ne
distraheretur, creditor, si distraxerit, furti obligatur, nisi ei ter fuerit
denuntiatum ut solvat, et cessaverit' Dig. 13. 7. 4. The remedies
again were the same, whether the pledge was effected by pignus or
hypotheca: so that in Justinian’s time (as he’ remarks, Bk. iv. 6. 7
inf.), there was but one surviving point of difference between thern: if
possession of the object pledged passed to the creditor, it was called
pignus, if·not, hypotheca; cf. Dig. 20. 1. 5. 1 (Marcianus): ‘inter
pignus et hypothecam tantum nominis sonus differt! The enumera-
tion of pignus among the iura in re aliena is thus accounted for:
it is a right in the property of another, sensu Romano, only qua
hypotheca.

The modes in which the rigllt was extinguished' require a brief
notice. It ceased to exist with the destruction of the object pledged‚
Dig. 20. 6. 8. pr.: it might be released‚ without affecting the debt
which it secured, and that either by legacy or agreement inter νίνοε,
Dig. ib. 4. 1 ; ib. 9. 3: and under certain circumstances it could be
destroyed or affected by usucapio or limitation of actions: see Dig.
41. 3. 44. 53 Cod. 7. 36. 13 8. 30. 2. B'ut as a general rule the
right of pledge ceases to exist only along with the principal debt:
