nothing at all as heim, or at least the portion they can take is limited
by law. Between these two classes there is an important difference.
The will is void, if the person instituted lacks testamenti factio at the
date either of the execution of the will, or of the testator’s decease, or at
which he ought to make aditio, Dig. 28. 5. 49. 1, Tit. 19. 4 ins. But
where one of the second class was instituted, the will was never void on
that ground alone, and capacity to take was required to exist only at the
time when the benefit vested: ‘ non oportet prius de condicione cuius-
‚quam quaeri, quam hereditas legatumve ad eum pertinet.’

These who could not be validly instituted at all are (1) peregrini3 (2)
intestabiles, Dig. 28. 1. 18. 1, ib. 263 niceph. ad lnst. ii. ιο. 6, though
the incapacity of this class in Justinian's time has been doubted3 (3)
heretics, Cod. 1. 5. 4, and apostates, Cod. 1. 7. 3 and 43 (4) children of
persons convicted of treason‚ Cod. 9. 8. 5. 1 ; (5) children of and parties
to unlawful marriages could not be instituted, the former by the parents,
the latter by one another, -Cod, 5. 5. 6; 5. 9. 6, ib. 27. 2 ; (6) incertae per·
sonae, in particular (a) postumi 3 but the last relic of this mle, viz. that a
postumus alienus could not be instituted heir or take a legacy was
repealed by Justinian himself, Tit. 20. 28, Bk. iii. 9. pr. infi: and (b)
juristic persons, Ulpian‚ reg. 22. 5. This restriction had, however, to a
large extent been removed ; the fiscus could be instituted heir, and so
could municipal corporations (Cod. 6. 24. 12), churches, and religious
and charitable foundations (Cod. 1. 2. 1 and 2 3). Other corporations
could acquire testamenti factio only by special grant from the Emperor,
Cod. 6. 24‘· 8 ; (7) the lex Voconia, 13.c. 169, had made women incapable
of being instituted heirs to persons ranked in the highest class of the
census as possessing 100,000 sesterces or upwards (Gaius ii. 274), though
they might be legatees to the extent of half the property, Quintil. declam.
264. This disqualifi'cation was quite obsolete under Justinian.

Among the enactments disabling certain classes from taking under a
will either in whole or in part are the following :--

(1) By the lex Iunia Norbana Latini Iuniani were prohibited from
taking either as heirs or as legateeS, unless they acquired the civitas
within 100 days, Gaius i. 23—4, ii. 110, 275, Ulpian‚ reg. 17. 1.

(2) By a lex Iulia of AugustuS, the coelebs (unmarried person) could
take nothing under the will of one unrelated to him or her within the
sixth degree as either heir or legatee, unless he or she married within
100 days next after hearing of the right. Certain classes were excepted
on account of age, physical incapacity, etc.‚ Ulpian‚ reg. 14. 16 and 18. ’

(3) By the lex Papia Poppaea, five years later in date, the orbus (i. e.
person who had been married but had no children living, Ulpian‚ reg.
16. 1) could take under wills of persons outside the sixth degree only a
moiety of what was given them. One child was sufficient to save a man
from the statute, for ingenuae three, for libertae four were required.
