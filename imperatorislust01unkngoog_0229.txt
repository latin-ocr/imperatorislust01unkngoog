Tit. 6.] DE USUCAPIONIBUS, E TC. 217

est, ut res quidem mobiles per triennium usucapiantur, immo-
biles vero per longi temporis possessionem, id est inter prae-
sentes decennio, inter absentes viginti annis usucapiantur et
his modis non solum in Italia, sed in omni terra, quae nostro

imperio gubernatur, dominium rerum iusta causa possessionis

praecedente adquiratur.

non-owner sells and delivers property, the purchaser, besides this causa
(pro empto) must not know that it belongs to some one other than the
vendor, or that the vendor has no authority to sell ; ‘ bonae fidei emptor
esse videtur, qui ignoravit earn rem alienam esse, aut putavit eum, qui
vendidit, ius vendendi habere, puta procuratorem aut tutorem esse ’ Dig.
5ο. 16. 109. By Roman law bona fides was required only at the incep-
tion of possession, and in sales also at the time of the contract : under
the canon and modern civil law it is different.

(4) The possession must continue uninterruptedly during the period
fixed by law3 in case os interruption (usurpatio) the whole time must
commence and run again. The time required by the Twelve Tables
was two years sor acquisition of immoveables, one for that of moveableS.

The exclusion of provincial soil from the operation of usucapio led
indirectly to very considerable changes in the law. ΤΙιε ground upon
which Justinian tells us usucapio was recognised—ne rerum dominia in ·
incerto essent—was as real a one in the provinces 'as in Italy3 and in
them its place was taken by an analogous praetorian institution, longi
temporis praescriptio or possessi0. By this, if a man possessed land for
ten years (or twenty, if the owner lived out of the province), the latter's
action for its recovery could, after the lapse of that period, be defeated
by a plea (called originally praescripti0‚ later exceptio) alleging the length
of the defendant's possession. The rules already stated as to iusta
causa and bona fides, and the positive enactments excluding certain
things from this mode of acquisition, were applied here as well as
in usucapi03 and there is evidence that by this new institution res
mobiles could be acquired (by peregrini) as well as land. It operated
at first, as it were, as a Statute of Limitation only, but eventually it
conferred ownership, the longi temporis possessor being allowed to
bring a real action for the recovery of the object if deprived of it; see
cod. 7. 39. 8. pr.

, When Justinian became emperor, the law os Prescription in his
dominions consisted really of two heterogeneous portions. Res mobiles
could be acquired by the old civil law usucapio in a year; but prac-
tically all the soil of the Eastern Empire was ‘provinciaL’ so that the
old biennii usucapio had no application3 its place was supplied by the
praetorian longi temporis possessio of ten or twenty years. Justinian
reformed the old law as follows : (1) he did away with the old legal dis-
tinction between Italian and provincial soi13 (2) altered the periods of
time required, as stated in this section, three years instead of one being
now necessary for the usucapio of res mobiles; and (3) upon the·
