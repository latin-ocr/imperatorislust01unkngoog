quod servi vestri ex traditione nanciscuntur sive quid stipu-
lentur vel ex qualibet alia causa adquirunt. hoc enim vobis
et ignorantibus et invitis obvenit. ipse enim servus qui in
potestate alterius est nihil suum habere potest. sed si heres
institutus sit, non alias nisi iussu vestro hereditatem adire·
potest: et si iubentibus vobis adierit, vobis hereditas adquiri-

venienter scilicet legatum per eos vobis adquiritur. non solum
autem proprietas per eos quos in potestate habetis adquiritur
vobis, sed etiam possessio ε cuiuscumque enim rei possessionem
adepti fuerint, id vos possidere videmini. unde etiam per eos
usucapio vel longi temporis possessio vobis accedit. De his 4
autem servis, in quibus tantum usum fructum habetis, ita
placuit, ut, quidquid ex re vestra vel ex operibus suis adquir-

maternal ancestors by any title whatever: Theodosius 11 added lucra
nuptialia (dos and donatio propter nuptias), and reformed the mles as to
the intestate succession to peculium adventitium and preferring the
child’s own issue to the pater, who by Leo and Anthemius was postponed
also to brothers and sisters. Justinian, as he says in § 1, included under
peculium adventitium (which in the text is called ‘res quae adquisitionem
effugiunt’) all that the child acquired otherwise than ex re patris or in the
way of peculium castrense or quasicastrense z under his legislation con-
sequently achild might have rights over property of three kinds, over one
of which he had the absolute control ; one over which his pater had a
usufruct, while he was its dominus; and lastly peculium profectitium,
property os the pater which the latter could resume at will, and of which
he himself had only the use and enjoyment. If he were emacipated,
the father originally was entitled absolutely to half the peculium ad-
ventitium, ‘ quasi pro pretio emancipationis :’ the change which Justinian
made in this matter is mentioned in § 2.
