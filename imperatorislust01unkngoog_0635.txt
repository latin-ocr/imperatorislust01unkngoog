EARLIER HIS T ΟΕ Υ OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 623

‘involving questions of ownership and status, it may be conjectured
that it was at one time the only form of action proper known to the
Romans ς for of the two other legis actiones which we have still to
examine, we know one to have been of later introduction, and to have
related to cases which previously were tried by sacramentum (Gaius
iv. 20); while the comparative freedom of the other from the strict
punctiliousness characteristic of very early procedure seems to justify
us in denying it any very great antiquity ¹. All three, however, being
actions proper, necessitated the attendance of both parties before the
magistrate, and to secure this was the business of the plaintiff. A
summons from the court or magistrate, which we now regard as the
indispensable mode of commencing legal proceedingS‚ was at Rome
unheard of for many centuries. The first words of the Twelve
Tables which have survived to us prescribed the mode of dealing with
a defendant who refused to attend to his plaintiff’s summons or ‘ in
ius vocatio 3 ’ the latter, after appealing to witnesses‚ could lay hands
upon and take him by force before the praetor. The ‘ Real ⁹ form of
sacramentum is familiar to every reader of Sir Henry Maine’s ‘Ancient
Law.’ It may be said to consist of three dramatic acts or stages, the ,
first of which presents to us an oral pleading or altercation. The
subject of dispute, e.g. a slave—or is it be too large, a portion of it,
is brought into court: whereupon the plaintiff, holding in one hand
the festuca, or symbol of absolute dominion, grasped it with the other,
and touching it with the festuca said ‘hunc ego hominem (e.g.)e1
iure Quiritium meum esse aio secundum suam causam sicut dixi:
ecce tibi vindictam imposui.’ This form was repeated by the de-
fendant; and both now grasping the object os their dispute‚ we reach
the second act of the drama, a pretended trial by battle, symbolised
in this simultaneous seizure or ‘ manuum consertio! Lastly‚ to avert
the simulated prospect of bloodshed, the state steps in 3 the praetor,
in the phrase ‘ mittite ambo hominem‚' turns actual strife into peaceful
arbitration. The plaintiff now demands of the defendant the ground
of his claim, and having heard it challenges him to lay a wager, the
amount of which was fixed by the Twelve TableS, on its justice; a
challenge which is repeated by his adversary. It is from the stake in
this wager (sacramentum) that the action got its name; it was for-
feited hythe loser to the aerarium, and originally was deposited, pend-
ing trial, ‘ in sacr0‚’ under the custody of the gods 3 subsequently
immediate deposit was dispensed with, the praetor taking security

² Keller, however (Civil Procas p. 77), regards iudicis arbitrive postulatio as
coeval with sacramentum.
