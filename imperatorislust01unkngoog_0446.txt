his socii their fair share, ib. 67. pr.; conversely he can claim to be in·
demnified for all personal losses and expenses incurred in partnership
affairS, ib. 38. 1 3 52. 4, and in societas omnium bonorum to have all his
debts‚ except those incurred 'ex delicto (see p. 429) discharged from
the common property. Losses arising from the insolvency of one partner
must be divided among all according to the principles stated in ἕξ 1-3
supr. and notes; Dig. 17. 2. 63. 5 ; ib. 67. pr.

The remedy by which partners enforced these duties against one
another was the actio pro socie, condemnation in which entailed infamia,
Bk. iv. 16. 22 inf.; but the defendant could claim beneficium com-
petentiae against the rest, i. e. they were not entitled to take all his
property in satisfaction of their claims, but must leave him enough to
supply the bare necessities of life, Book iv. 6. 38 infi, though Dig. 42. 1.
16 (perhaps incorrectly) limits the beneficium to societas omnium bono·
rum. Division of the joint property could be compelled by the actio
communi dividunde, Bk. iv. 6. 203 ib. 28 ; iv. 17. 5 inf.

The question of the rights of partners against, and their duties toward5‚
third persons, is a different one. If all the partners together enter into
a eontract with some one else, they are entitled and bound in relation to
him in the ratio of their shares in the lucrum and damnum: ‘si tamen
plures per se navem exerceant, pro portionibus exercitionis conveniuntur,
neque invicem sui magistri videntur’ Dig. 14. 1. 4. pr., ‘quamvis actio
ex empto cum singulis sit per portione, qua socii fuerunt’ Dig. 21. 1. 44.
1. By special agreement such eontract may produce an active or passive
correal obligation in favour of or binding the partners, and where they
are bankers such an obligation results ipso-iure from all strictly banking
transactions entered into by any of them: ‘si plures sint qui eandem
actionem habent, unius loeo habentur: utputa plures sunt rei stipulandi
vel plures argentarii, quorum nomina simul facta sunt3 unius loco nume-
rabuntur, quia unum debitum est’ Dig. 2. 14. 9. pr. ; ib. 25. pr. 3 ib. 27.
’ But if the eontract is made by one or some only of the partners, the
question arises how far they confer rights and impose obligations on the
rest. 1f the transaction is clearly a partnership transaction, the latter
can sue upon it only as assigneeS, even though it was entered into by
their own express instructions, though they are entitled to a cessio of
the right os action, which, if necessary, they can compel by judicial
process.

As regards their liabilities, it should be carefully observed that the
partnership is never conceived as a fictitious person, capable in itself of
having rights and owing duties, as distinct from the partners ς the latter
cannot claim that business creditor-S, in the event of the firm becoming
insolvent, shall limit their demands to the partnership assetS, though
they can insist on the latter being proceeded against and exhausted
first, Dig. 17. 2. 65. 14. Three cases, in which the eontract is not made
by all the partners collectively, need to be distinguished:
