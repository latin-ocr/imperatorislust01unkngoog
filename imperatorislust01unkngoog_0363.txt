DE SENA‘rth CONSULTO TE'RTULLIANO.

Lex duodecim tabularum ita stricto iure utebatur et prae-
ponebat masculorum progeniem et e03, qui per feminini sexus
necessitudinem sibi iunguntur, adeo expellebat, ut ne quidem
inter matrem et filium filiamve ultro citroque hereditatis
capiendae ius daret, nisi quod praetores ex proximitate
cognatorum eas personas ad successionem bonorum pos-
sessione unde cognati accommodata vocabant. Sed hae 1
iuris angustiae postea emendatae sunt. et primus quidem
divus Claudius matri ad solacium liberorum amissorum le-
gitimam eorum detulit hereditatem. Postea autem senatus 2
consulto Tertulliano, quod divi Hadriani temporibus factum
est, plenissime de tristi successione matri, non etiam aviae
deferenda cautum est: ut mater ingenua trium liberorum ius
habens, libertina quattuor ad bona filiorum filiarumve ad-
mittatur intestatorum mortuorum, licet in potestate parentis
est, ut scilicet, cum alieno iuri subiecta est, iussu eius adeat

⁸1¹1t. 111. Τὴο only claim which a woman had to succeed to her chil-

mariti, she became their agnate in the nearest possible degree, and so
came in in default of sui, Gaius iii. 24.

ξ 2. The SC. Tertullianum, ΑΛ). 158, was not passed under Hadrian, as
is stated in the text, but under A. Pius, who succeeded Hadrian A.D. 138,
and was himself succeeded by M. Aurelius ΑΛ). 161 (Zonaras 12. 1), so
that it is curious that it is not mentioned by Gaius, who (ii. 195) speaks of
A. Pius as deceased. An extension, clearly, of the lex Papia Poppaea,
which consen-ed rights on women with a certain number of children
(p. 254 supr„ Tit. 7. 2 inf.) 3 it gave to ingenuae who had borne three, and
libertinae who had borne four children (§ 4 ἰαί), a statutory title to
succeed their own issue who died intestate in preference to the agnates ς
by whom they were themselves excluded appears from the next section.

§3. The mother was excluded from the first by the children of a
deceased son, whether they ranked as liberi or as cognati (for which see
-Tit. 1. 13 supr.)‚ the latter by a rescript of A. Pius, Dig. 38. 17. 2. 9. After
the enactment of the SC. Orfitianum it was ruled by imperial constitu-
tionS, as is remarked in the text, that she must give way also to the
children of a deceased daughter, Cod. 6. 57. ’1. 4; 6. 55. 11. She was
also postponed to the ‚deceased c-hild's natural father, whether he were
