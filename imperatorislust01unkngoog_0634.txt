6 22 EXCURSUS Χ.

Publilia; wherever else it was still available it was pura, and its only
peculiar incident was that the debtor was oest in double damages if
he unsuccessfully denied his liability (lis crescens).

The Romans themselves never doubted that manus iniectio was a true
legis actiO, though it was no less a form of execution thau pignoris
oepio: the former was Personal, the latter was Rea! execution. The
fact would seem to be, as is remarked by Mr. Poste ¹, that manus iniectio
has two meanings. Sometimes it is 3 solemn act of self-redreSS, viz.
where the plaintiff’ 3 right is incontestable, and the defendant submits.
But at other times it is the first stage iu a legis actim viz. where the
defendant denies his liability, and resists the claim either in person
or through a vindex: and it seems probable that it was called
Statute-Process only in this latter case. If this be true, the applioetion
of the term ‘legis actio ’ to pignoris capio alone remains anomalous.
So sar as we know it, pignoris capio was purely extra-judicial: if 3
man had 3 claim which the law allowed him to enforce in this manner,
he had no need of assistance from the magistrate ; the praetor did not
appear at any stage of the proceedingS, which presented a picture of
as pure sels-redress as could be found before courts and magistrates
had come into existence. Why then is it called an ‘actio’ at all?
Arguing from the analogy of manus iniectio, it would not be rash to
conjecture that pignoris capio also has two meanings, and that it was
a legis actio only when the person distrained upon denied his liability‚
and pushed proceedings to a regular action. It is well known that
in the English law of Distress this is done by an action of Replevin‚
in which the distrainee 13 plaintiff and the (113331301- defendant: but
the parallel of manus iniectio makes it probable that in Roman law
the r6les were reversed, and that if the distress was alleged to be
unlawful the distrainor was bound to come forward as plaintiffjn an
action to justify his act, by forcing the other to redeem his pledge at
3 price double the amount of the original debt ⁸.

Of the three other legis actiones it seems probable that the oldest
is the sacramentum. Gaius says it was ‘ actio generalis: i. e. the
proper remedy in all cases for which no other procedure had been
ordained by statute. Though he describes it to us as a real action,

¹ Gaius p. 507.

² This conjecture is supported by the known facts of the publicanus, who was
allowed to proceed by pignoris capio even after the introduction of the formulas-y
system: and Gaius' words (ir. 32) suggest that the publicanus sued the taxpayer
who was in arrears in order to compel him to redeem the property seized at a sum

in excess of that actually due. Cicero speaks (in Verrem iii. 11. 27) of ⁸ publica-
nus petitor ac pignerator?
