POSSESSION. 327

different view is taken hy Puchta, who connects the earliest protection
of Possession with the primitive form of Real Action. In this, both
plaintiff and defendant were, until decision of the suit, regarded by
the law as equally entitled to the dominium. It was necessary, how-
ever, that one of them should be magisterially instated in the pos-
session of the disputed property pending litigation, and we learn from
Gaius (iv. 16) how such interim possession was awarded. Having
been magisterially awarded, it must also be magisterially protected,
and this was done by an interdict3 a remedy which oeme subsequently
to be used for the protection of all Possession, independently of a
pending suit.

Mr. Hunter (Roman Law pp. 195-222) believes that Possessio
entirely changed its meaning in the course of Roman legal history.
In origin he connects it with the technical incapacity of aliens to own

property iure civili rather than with the occupatiori os ager publicuS, ”

and maintains that it properly means Equitable or Gentile ownership.
When, aster the edict os Caracalla, all subjects of the Empire prac—
tically became cives, its functionS, in this connection, were exhausted,
and it ‘ came to have precisely the same meaning that it has in every
system of law 3 it is a temporary separation between the person
exercising rights and the person invested by law with rights!

There is no evidence of this change of meaning, and nothing to
show that the Roman lawyer's idea of Possessio differed in the time
of Justinian from what it had been in that of Cicem, or that he con-
ceived Possession as otherwise than the very antipodes os dominium
(⁴ nihil commune habet possessio cum proprietate’ Dig. 4¹· a. 12. 1);
or, finally, that the ‘ gentile’ ownership of the alien (p. 187 supr.) was
specially protected by interdicts; he recovered his property, not by
an interdict, but by a real action, fictitia or utilis perhaps, but still
a remedy which recognised his proprietorship. On the other hand,
as all Possession, whether iusta or iniusta, whether bona fide or mala
fide, was protected by interdictS, to dwell upon the close resemblance,
the almost complete material identity, between many cases os bona
fide Possession, and Equitable ownership, as Mr. Hunter does, is not
to the point. The actio Publiciana was open to any possessor whose

Possession could ripen by usucapio into ownership; but his interest ,

was more than Possession3 it was inchoate or Bonitarian ownership,
or, adopting an expression of Mr. Poste’s (Gaius p. 642), we may
say that the ius in rem, and the interdiu-possession, are distinct
though concurrent. The fallacy of arguing that, because many cases
of (bona fide) Possession are equivalent to Bonitarian ownership,
