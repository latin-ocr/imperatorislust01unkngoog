PUBLIC ΛΝΒ PRIVAZ'E LAW. 19

were to hold land at all, hold it in absolute private ownership,
ex iure Quiritium. And thus, it is argued, private ownership of 13ηά
originated with the plebeians, and was extended to the populus from
a feeling that the latter ought in no way to be inferior to a population
which politically lay so far below it. Similarly, emancipation, as a
form of escape from patria potestas, manumission of slaves and the
resulting patronatus, nexum, and manus iniectio, are all supposed to
have been institutious due to the plebeian development of private
law.

VThis view, however, of the relation of public to private law in early
Rome, attractive though it is, and though very widely accepted, has
not passed without challenge. By its chief opponent¹ the earliest
character of the Roman law is explained by reference to another
principle, that of the ‘ subjective will: or mere brute force and indi·
vidual strength, uncontrolled by any state organisation whatever.
‘ Might is right ’ is the first principle by which disputes between man
and man are determined. This social condition is followed by a
period in which sels-tedress is no longer arbitr-ary, but is regulated by
minute rules sanctioned by custom² ; and eventually the stage of
legal history is reached which is so vividly represented to us in the
‘ legis actio sacramenti‚' disputes being referred at first to the arbitration
of a ‘ vir pietate gravis: though a private individual, and subsequently
to that of an official of the state. The question thus arises, What
then is the origin of the state? This is found in the family organiza-
tion, and in the association of a number of families connected by
real’ or fictitious relationship for the purpose of common defence,
and forming an aggregate known to us as the gens: ‘die Gens
ist eine Familie im Grossen, und ein Staat im Kleinen.' The
individual thus precedes the family, the family the genS, and the
gens the state3 and from the point of view of the ‘ subjective
principle’ the state is based upon a contract or quasi contract,
whence the connection of the terms pax, pactum, pacisci.

To those who hold this view, private law appears, in origin,
entirely independent of the state. ⁶ The plausibility of the theory
(first stated) is due to the public forms in which private law at first is
clothed, and in the absence of opposition between the different parts
of the system. It is, however, just those forms which prove that the
