2 fluminibusque. Est autem litus maris, quatenus hibernus
fluctus maximus excurrit. Riparum quoque usus publicus

3 est iuris gentium, sicut ipsius fluminis: itaque navem ad eas

4 appellere, funes ex arboribus ibi natis religare, onus aliquid in
his reponere cuilibet liberum est, sicuti per ipsum flumen
navigare. sed proprietas earum illorum est, quorum praediis
haerent : qua de causa arbores quoque in isdem natae eorun-

sicut ipsius maris : et ob id quibuslibet liberum est casam ibi
imponere, in qua se recipiant, sicut retia siccare et ex mare
deducere. proprietas autem eorum potest intellegi nullius esse,
sed eiusdem iuris esse, cuius et mare et quae subiacent mari,

quae in civitatibus sunt, ut theatra stadia et similia et si qua
alia sunt communia civitatium.

§a Res publicae seem to be divisible into two classes, (1) Things
which belong to and are used by the state as by a private person: e. g.
public slaves, money, stores, etc.: these are not properly extra patri-
monium nostrum. (2) Things which are publico usui destinatae, (i.e.
not communes generally, but only to cives), e. g. r'oadS, harbours, public
rivers (i.e. ‘ flumina perennia ' Dig. 43. 12. 3) and their beds. The banks
of public rivers were private property, subjeeted by the law to a kind of
servitude in favour of all members of the state, ξ 4 inf.

ξ 6. Universitas here seems to be used as equivalent to civitaS, i.e. a
Roman city or municipium. Taken in this sense, res universitatis are
analogous to res publicae, and are divisible in the same manner. Such
property only of a provincial city as is municipum usui destinatum is
extra patrimonium: a res publica is a thing which any civis may use:
a res universitatis is one which may be used as of right only by the
members of the universitas·

Taken in its widest sense, universitas is equivalent to the ‘juristie
person’ of modern writers, For the definition and characteristics of
juristic persons in general reference may be made to Holland’s Juris-
prudence p. 22 5 sq.: those recognised by Roman law may be sub-
divided into universitates personarum and universitates bonorum. [The
latter should not be eonfounded with so-ealled universitates rerum (dis-
tantium), such as a flock of sheep, which have no independent legal
existence apart from the elements which go to make them up.]

A universitas personarum (or corporation) is an aggregate of natural
persons forming an ideal whole, regarded by the law as a ‘person ² distinct
from its members sor the time being, because its existence does not
cease along with theirs, and invested with rights and subject to duties,
other than those of the individuals, taken singly, of which it is com-
