GROWTH OF IMPERIAL LEGISLATION. 57

right and ought to be done. Now the peoples of whom the empire
was composed were so diverse that they had but one characteristic
in common, viz. that they were not Romans· They could have no
common legal habit as a nation, and thus could generate no new
positive customary law save merely local rules; the only influence
they could unite to exercise was a negative one, to abandon all such
portions of the system as were purely and exclusively Roman. And
this destructive work, as we have seen, they did do· So with the
other sources os the ius scriptum which are enumerated in the
Institutes (i. 2. 3). Leges proper, plebiscita, and senatus consulta,
as we know, had long been obsolete 3 and by the ordinance cited a
few lines above, Constantine had given the last blow to the edicta
magistratuum. Stin, the development of law might have been carried
on, as it had been from Augustus to Maximian. by the responsa
prudentium and systematic treaties of authorized jurists; but we look
in vain for these forms os legal activity‚ for true Jurisprudence had
already died a natural death. The juristic literature of the period
now under consideration consists merely of compilations from statutes
or constitutions and from the writings os earlier prudentes. Theodo-
sius 11 (mn. 408-450) attests the cessation os true juristic work in
the enactment by which he promulgated his codex constitutionum ι
‘ saepe nostra clementia dubitavit, quae causa faceret, ut tantis pro-
positis praemiis, quibus artes et studia nutriuntur, tam pauci raroque
extiterint, qui plena iuris civilis scientia ditarentur, et in tanto lucu-
brationum tristi pallore vix unus aut alter receperit soliditatem per-
fectae docti-inae! His own.explanati0n os the phenomenon is the
vast multiplicity of imperial ordinances and juristie books without an
adequate study of which a knowledge of the law was impossible ; and
the hope is expressed that a remedy for this will be afforded by the
comparatively small dimensione of his own compilation.

Direct imperial legislation thus remained the only form in which
changes could be effected in positive law. What Justinian says in
Cod. 1. 14. 12 is true of the whole period extending backward from
himself to Constantine: ‘ In praesenti leges condere soli imperatori
concessum est, et leges interpretari solum dignum imperio esse
oportet ; ' and this will account for the ever-increasing activity of the
imperial legislation. In the interval of 130 years between Constan-
tine and Theodosius 11 the mass of general constitutions had already
become so great that the latter emperor’s compilation formed a book '
os very considerable dimensione», and yet in this much was curtailed,
still more omitted 3 for instance, it contained none of the enactments
