CUSTOMARY LA W—-LEGES CURJA TAE. 3

compilation towards the end of the republic by Granius FlaccuS, which
is quoted in Dig. 50. 16. 144. It is clear, from the passage cited above
from the Digest, that the jur-ist Pomponius assumed the identity of the
work, on which Flaccus based his commentary, with the original ius
civile Papirianum; but the truth of his assumption is much doubted by
later historians. However, even if we allow that the leges regiae were
genuine enactments, introduced, on the motion of the king, by the
senate into the comitia curiata, and there clothed with the force of
law, they were probably not more than formal restatements of cus·
tomary law already binding. That PapiriuS‚ a pontifex, was so familiar
with their contents may possibly be taken to show that they were
merely os sacerdotal import3 and if in fact his collection of them sur-
vived to the time of Granius Flaccus, it is probable that it was used by
the later pontifices only to enforce religious forms of observance
through its assumed derivation from the consecrated figures of the
mythical kings of Roman antiquity. Nothing of these leges has been
preserved, in its original shape, to our own time, though some of their
substance has been collected in a fragmentary form by earlier writerS,
whose names are enumerated in the critique of a modern civilian on
this subJect ¹.

The application os the word ‘ curiatae ’ to these leges in the pas·
sage last cited from the Digest leads one on to describe the origin
and early history of the comitia or legislative assemblies of Rome.
The earliest of these was the comitia curiata, which, when convoked
for certain kinds of business, such as the sanctioning of testaments
(Inst. ii. ro. ι), was called ‘comitia calata! Whatever opinion may be .
held as to the names and ethnic origin of the three tribes (RamneS,
LucereS, and Tities or Quirites) from whose union the Roman state
is mythically said to have sprung, it cannot be denied that the populus
Romanus, when we first know anything certain about it, was actually
divided into three tribes, each of which, with its distinct territory, com·
prised ten curiae, while each curia consisted of ten decuriae or gentes,
and meh gens of an indefinite number of familieS‚ between which'
there was originally perhaps a genuine tie of blood, which gradually
became a mere fiction, respected and supported for the sake of the
ancient family worship and religious riteS. The family was thus not
merely a microcosm os the state ; it was the foundation on which were,
based all the privileges which the Roman citizen enjoyed within the
state ; the populus contained the tribe, the tribe the curia, the curia
