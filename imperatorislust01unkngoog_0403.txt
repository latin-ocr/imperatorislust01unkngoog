Tit. 15.] DE VERBORUM OBLIGA T [ΘΝΕ. 39 t

bitur. Sub condicione stipulatio fit, cum in aliquem casum 4
differtur obligati0‚ ut, si aliquid factum fuerit aut non fuerit,
stipulatio committatur, veluti ‘si Titius consul factus fuerit,
quinque aureos dare spondes?' si quis ita stipuletur ‘si in
Capitolium non ascender0, dare spondes?’ perinde erit, ac
si stipulatus esset cum morietur dari sibi. ex condicionali
stipulatione tantum spes est debitum iri, eamque ipsam spem
transmittimus, si, priusquam condicio existat, mors nobis

annuity of 100 aurei for five yearS, 500 might be promised in five equal
shares ex die; or instead os promising 100 per annum for a person’s
lifetime, a number of separate promises of 100 might be made ex die,
each under the suspensive condition of the promisee’s living to such
or such a birthday.

§ 4. We have seen (ξ 2 supr.) that an immediate, though not necessarily
a civil, obligation arose from a promise ex die 3 e. g. Kalendis Martiis dare
spondes? A promise made subject to a suspensive condition—e. g. si
Titius consul suerit factus—might at first sight seem to have no legal
effect at all ε ‘ ante condicionem non recte agi, curn nihil ad interim de-
beatur' Dig. 20. 1. 13. 5. Yet this is clearly not so in fact; sor (1) it is
said in the text that the promisee’s hope os the condition being fulfilled,
and of the debt so springing into actual existence, passes to his heres;
if the conditional promise had no effect until condicio existit there could
be nothing to pass to the heir at all, cf. Tit. 19. 25 inf. It was otherwise
with legacies, on account of their strictly personal nature: unless the
condition were fulfilled before the legatee's decease the latter's heir was
not benefited, Dig. 36. 2. 5. pr. and 2, Cod. 6. 51. 73 cf. note on Bk. ii.
20. 20 supr. (2) The person who will be bound to an act or forbearance
- on the fulfilment of the condition is unable by any act of his own to
escape his possible liability in the future ε pro tanto he is bound already.
This may be illustrated by Dig. 17. 2. 27. ‘si (socius) sub condicione
promiserat et distracta societate condicio extitit, ex communi solvendum
est,' Dig. 45. 1. 78. pr. ‘si filiusfamilias sub condicione stipulatus eman·
cipatus fuerit, deinde extiterit condici0‚ patri actio competit 3' cf. Dig. 20.
1. 13. 5 ; 45. 3. 26. (3) Even more direct is Dig. 44. 7. 42. pr. ‘is, cui sub
condicione legatum est, pendente condicione non est creditor, sed tunc
cum extiterit condicio, quamvis eum, qui stipulatus est sub condicione,
placet etiarn pendente condicione creditorem esse! Dig. 12. 6. 16, however,
shows that the lang-uage here is unguarded, and that until the condition
is sulfilled there was no real obligati0‚ even naturalis, sor is payment were
made pendente condicione the money could be recovered by condictio
indebiti: cf. Dig. ib. 183 ib. 443 ib. 56. Thus the legal position of a
promisee sub condicione is difficult to describe 3 there is as yet no obli-
gation‚ and yet he is not absolutely without right3 the effect of the
promise until the condition is fulfilled is only, as Fitting calls it, ‘ pre-
liminary’ (Vomnrkung).
