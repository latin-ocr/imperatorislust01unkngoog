LEGES PUBLILIAE ΛΝΒ HORTENSIA. ·23

and it seems not improbable that, by that statute, it was provided that
plebiscita which had no constitutional import, or which related to
matters os purely private law, should not require confirmation by the
centuries to acquire universal validity. The first of the leges Publiliae
apparently extended this exemption to all plebiscita, whatever their
content, the effect of it being, as stated by Livy (viii. η), ‘ut plebiscita
omnes Quirites tenerent :¹ from this we should doubtless infer that the
patricians now entered as fully into the business of the comitia tributa
as into that of the assembly of the centuries, The necessity os sena-
torial sanction to plebiscita was, however, not yet dispensed with; this
was effected by the lex Hortensia, a. c. 287 (Inst. i. 2. 4), which was
the outcome of a third plebeian secession, and the final act by which
resolutions of the plebs were placed on a footing 'of complete equality
with leges passed in the comitia centuriata (‘ sed postea lex Hortensia
lata est, qua cautum est ut plebiscita universum populum tenerent;
itaque eo modo legibus exaequata sunt’ Gaius i. 3). The numbers of
the plebs were largely augmented B. c. 312, when Appius Caecus, the
censor, distributed among the tribes a great mass os libertini, a term
which at this epoch denoted the freeborn descendants of a manu·
mitted slave ¹. These libertini were thus enrolled in the centurieS,
and possessed very considerable influence through the wealth which
they derived from their almost exclusive control of Roman bandierasts
and commerce, occupations which were deemed humiliating and
derogatory to genuine Quirites ; in Rome they played the part, and
exercised the influence, though in a far less degree, which with us are
connected with ‘the city! Eight years later than the censorship of
Appius Caecus, the democratic tendency of his measure was to some
degree counteracted by the new censom, Q. Fabius and P. Decius,
who confined the ‘ forensis turba’ of libertini to the fou'r city tribeS,
and thus reduced the preponderance which the lower orders had ac-
quired in the two important comitia.

The effect of the second lex Publilia, according to Livy, was ‘ ut
legum quae comitiis centuriatis ferrentur ante initum suffragium patres
auctores fierent3' it thus merely reaffirmed the constitutional doctrine,
that no bill should be submitted to the centuries, with a view to its
becoming law, unless it had been previously approved by the senate.
It is clear from Cicero that in his time the Servian centurial constitu-
tion had undergone considerable alterationS, effected by in some way
combining the centurial organization with that of the tribes. The
