nulla actio extenditur. In simplum agitur veluti ex stipula· ‘22
tione, ex mutui datione, ex empto vendito, locato conduct0‚
mandato et denique ex' aliis compluribus causis. In duplum 23
agimus veluti furti nec manifesti, damni iniuriae ex lege Aquilia,
depositi ex quibusdam casibus: item servi corrupti, quae
competit in eum, cuius hortatu consiliove servus alienus fu-
gerit aut contumax adversus dominum factus est aut luxuriose
vivere coeperit aut denique quolibet modo deterior factus sit
(in qua actione etiam earum rerum, quas fugiendo servus
abstulit, aestimatio deducitur)’: item ex legat0, quod venera-
bilibus locis relictum est, secundum· ea quae supra diximus·

(e.g. C‘od. 6. 1. 7), or there may be two condemnations arising ex eadem

re, which added together exceed the quadruplum, e. g. Dig. 47. 9. 3. 8.
§23 The action under the lex Aquilia is in duplum· only adversus

infitiantem, § 19 supr., and that on the deposit only under the cir·
cumstances referred to in § 17. The actio servi corrupti (for which
cf. Tit. 1. 8 supr.) is said to be in duplum by the praetor in Dig. 11.

ξ 24. The libellus conventionis was a petition or bill addressed to the
judge, by which actions were commenced under the system of cognitio
in vogue in Justinian's time; and this is the sole meaning in his com·
pilations of in ius vocatio and actionis editio. It had to contain short
particulars of the plaintiff's claiin, so as to give the defendant a general
idea of the nature of the demand made against him, and to show more
specifically (1) the character of the right affirmed, e. g. whether it was real
or persona13 if the former, whether dominium, servitus, pledge, etc.; if
the latter, whether arising ex contractu or delicte, and what kind of con-
tract or delict3 (2) the thing or the wrongful act to which the action
related. This statement of claim is what is now meant by intenti0,
e. g. in ξ 33 inf.‚ cf. note on ξ 1 supr. It was necessary that it should be
signed by the plaintiff, or by·a notary on his behalf is' he could not write 3
by this he definitely assumed the responsibility of the action, which, how-
ever, he more formally acknowledged by entering·into a cauti0‚ in one of
the forms described in Tit. 11. 2 inf„ which was enrolled in the acta, and
by which he bound himself to bring the cause to trial within two months,
or in desault to pay the defendant double the costs which he had in-
curred, to push it through to judgment, and to pay the defendant's costs
in the event of defeat. Unless the judge refused the action, the libellus
was now registered in the acta, and the defendant was summoned (com-
moniti0, citatio) by an officer of the court (executor, viator), a copy of the
libellus being at the same time served upon him. In reply to this he
had to deliver a signed and dated libellus contradictionis or responsionis,
stating his defence, if any; to pay a see (sportulae, referred to in this
section) proportioned to the value of the matter in dispute, and to bind
