the defendant in exactly that amount; if he awarded a sum either
greater or less, he was guilty of a quasi-delict, ‘ ut qui litem suam
feeerit ’ (Bk. iv. 5. pr. supr.). This kind of condemnatio, mentioning a
specific sum, is found in condictio certi and in actions in factum
conceptae, which claim a liquidated penalty (as in Gaius iv. 46). In
all other actions the condemnatio was said to be incerta, and it was
the judge's duty ‘litem aestimare,' to fix the sum payable by the
defendant if the plaintiff succeeded in establishing his case. Even
in condemnatio incerta a distinction has to be drawn. It may be
absolutely incerta (or, as Gaius calls it in iv. 51, infinita), the judge’s
discretion in the litis aestimatio being completely unfettered¹: or,
secondly, a maximum may be fixed in the formula, below which the
iudex may assess the damages, but which he cannot exceed without

exposing himself to the action quasi ex delicto; here the condemnatio
was said to be incerta cum taxatione ².

Under the head of Condemnatio it seems convenient to describe
the actio and formula arbitraria. As a general rule, the condem-
nation of the defendant depends upon one condition only, and that a
positive one, viz. satisfactory proof of the plaintiffs right, or of the
facts alleged in the intentio: si paret . . . , condemna. But sorne-
times it was made to depend further on a second negative con-
dition, viz. non-performance by the defendant of some specific act,
which was introduced into the formula by the word nisi ⁸. Such a

¹ The following are examples. (i) In Real action—si paret . . . Auli Agerii
esse, quanti ea res est, tantam pecuniam A. Agerio N. Negidium condemna: si
nou paret, absolve. (ii) Iu Personal action—quod . . ., quicquid paret ob eam
rem dare facere oportere, eius rei tantam pecuniam condemna: si uon paret,
absolve.

² E. g. Iudex Α. Agerio·N. Negidium duntaxat sestertium x millia condemna.
The commouest form of taxatio is where the maximum is fixed in iure by the
plaintifl' subject to the praetor's approval, as was the case iu the actio iniuriae
(Gaius iii. 224), and in penal actions in which the penalty depended on the value
of an object, e.g. in furtum and rapina. There νικας, however, a different kind of
taxatio in those cases where the defendant was not personally liable for the whole
of what is properly the object of the action, but (e. g.) only so far as he has been
enriched at the plaintiff’s eost, or only so far as a peculium extends (actio de
peculio).

⁸ For examples of formulae arbitrariae see Mr. Poste's note on Gaius iv. 47. What
actions were arbitrariae is somewhat uncertain. Under them we may place without
hesitation most real actions, and of remedies in personam those praetorian actions
which were brought to obtain restitution (e. g. doli, metus) ι for noxa] actions see on
Bk. iv. 8 supr. From the fact that bonae fidei actions were sometimes called arbitria,
it has been supposed that their formula was always arbitraria. Mr. Poste thinks
that only such of them as aimed at restitution (e.g. depositi, commodati, locati, rei
uxoriae) were of this character. This view is to some extent supported by the
