Tit. 4.] DE JNJURJJS. 52 3

stituatur. Sed et lex Cornelia de iniuriis loquitur et iniuriarum 8
actionem introduxit. quae competit ob eam rem, quod se
pulsatum quis verberatumve domumve suam vi introitarn
esse dicat. domum autem accipimuS, sive in propria domo quis
habitat sive in conducta vel gratis sive hospitio receptus sit.
Atrox iniun'a aestimatur vel ex fact0, veluti si quis ab aliquo 9
vulneratus suerit vel fustibus caesus: vel ex loco, veluti si
cui in theatro vel in soro vel in conspectu praetoris iniuria

aestimata lite iudex hominem pecunia damnabat ³ Gell. 20. 1. The pecu·
niary penalties fixed by the Twelve Tables were 300 asses is the broken
bone were a free man’s, 150 is it were a slave's3 for all other iniuriae
25 asses, Gaius loc. cit. That the grossest libel could be atoned sor by
payment of this small sum argues the old Romans to have been not over
sensitive to abuse, unless it took the form of ribald song5‚ in which case
the penalty os death, fustuarium supplicium, was ordained by the Twelve
Tables, Paul. sent. rec. 5. 4. 6: cf. Cic. de republ. 4. ιο, Tusc. 4 2. After
the introduction os the praetorian penalties, the sum to be paid in cases
of atrox iniuria (ξ 9 inf.) was in Gaius’ time practically fixed by the praetor,
Gaius iii. 224. Thm Justinian does not mention this is perhaps to be
accounted sor by supposing that atrox iniuria was usually proceeded
against either criminally, ξ 10 ins„ or under the lex Cornelia, ξ 8 ins. The
praetorian action could be brought only within an annus utilis of the
commission os the offence, Cod. 9. 35. 5, and condemnation entailed
infamia, Tit. 16. 2 inf. The right of action was extinguished by the
death either os the person injured, or of the delinquent, the wrong being
purely personal‚ Dig. 47. 10. 13. pr.; this os course must be understood
to mean that the action was neither actively nor passively transmissible 3
the former, perhapS, because in many cases more than one person could
sue on the same iniuria.

§ 8. Whether this lex Cornelia, passed by Sulla nc. 81, was confined
to iniuriae, or was only a part os a larger statute, perhaps the lex Cornelia
de sicariiS‚ Tit. 18. 5 inf„ is doubtfu13 the former view is supported by
the fulness with which it seems to have treated iniuria, Dig. 47. 10. 5.
6-8; 48. 2. 12. 4. Its original object in any case was the criminal pro-
secution of the acts os violence to which it related (‘ apparet igitur omnem
iniuriam, quae manu fiat, lege Cornelia.contineri ' Dig. 47. 10. 5. pn), but
by gradual usage a civil action was developed under its provisionS, which,
though its scope was less than that os the older praetorian remedy, had
the advantage of being perpetua, i.e. not barred by lapse of a year:
‘etiam ex lege Cornelia iniuriarum actio civiliter moveri potest, con-
demnatione aestimatione iudicis facienda’ Dig. 47. 10. 37. 1. The
criminal proceedings under this statute apparently went out of use, Dig.
3. 3. 42. 1.

§ 9. Gaius (iii. 223) and Paulus (sent. rec. 5. 4 ιο) do not mention the
position of the wound as sufficient to make an iniuria atrox.
