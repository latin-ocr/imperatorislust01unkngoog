fraudulently overreached minors to a iudicium publicum entailing a
pecuniary mulct and infamia on conviction. In the face of such a pro-
secution few people would be likely to give credit to minors or even to
have any dealings with them whatsoever (PlautuS, Pseudolus 1. 3. 9,
Rudens 5. 4. 24): hence the rule was established (it is uncertain whether
by the praetor or by the statute itself : Capitolinus Marc. ιο is in favour
of the latter view) that minors who wished to contract or deal with others
should be compellable to receive a curator on their application, by whose

. assent to the transaction the penal consequences of the lex Plaetoria
would be avoided. M. Aurelius ordained that any minor, apart from
such special occasion, should be able to obtain from the praetor a gene·
ral curator to undertake the general administration of his property. A
further protection afforded to minors against the consequences os their
own inexperience or indiscretion was the praetorian practice of in in·
teg-rum restituti0, for which see on Bk. iv. 6. 33 inf.

§L Dio Cassius (44. 35) says that Julius Caesar appointed in his will
ἐπιτρόπους to Augustus ‘qui propter provectiorem aetatem curatores
fuerint: ’ these must have been magisterially confirmed. The reason why
testamentary appointment of curators was never allowed was perhaps
that in the earliest form of the institution (the cura of furiosi and prodigi)
a causae cognitio was required in order to settle whether the person
actually was furiosus and prodigus, and this would have seemed to admit
an undue interference of the magistrate with testamentary power.

ξ 2. This means only that a general curator could not be forced on a
minor: but he could be compelled to have one temporarily, ad certam
causam, in two cases: that mentioned here in the text (a judgment
against an undefended minor being void, Dig. 42. 1. 45. 6), and when his
creditor wished to discharge his debt and obtain a release, Dig. 4. 4.
7. 2.

Whether a minor who had a general curator could bind himself by
contract without the latter's consensus is disputed. The general rule
would seem to be that he could ε ‘ puberes sine curatoribus suis possunt
ex stipulatu obligari ³ Dig. 45. 1. 101, though, without it, he could not bind
himself by an alienation‚ e.g. sale or pledge, Cod. 2. 22. 3. But even
where he bound himself without the curator’s consent the curator could
not be compelled to satisfy the creditor out of the minor’s property: and
the latter could usually obtain in integrum restitutio from the praetor.
