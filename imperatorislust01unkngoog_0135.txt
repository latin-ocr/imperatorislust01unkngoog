filio variabatur, nostra processit decisio, qua permissum est ad
exemplum filiae furiosi filium quoque posse et sine patris

from the wife or some one on her behalf towards defraying the expenses
of the married state, ‘ ad matrimonii onera ferenda! The obligation to
provide a dos was imposed on the father or paternal grandfather partly
by the lex Papia Poppaea, partly by imperial constitutions, and this
whether the daughter or granddaughter was in power or not, Cod. 5. 1 1.
7. The mother was under no such obligation until after an enactment
os Diocletian and Maximian, and then only under exceptional circum·
stanceS, Cod. ς. 12. 14. This led to a difference of terminology : ‘dos aut
profectitia dicitur, id est, quam pater mulieris dedit, aut adventitia, id
est ea, quae a quovis alio data est' Ulpian, reg. 6. 1-3: dos receptitia
was a kind of adventitia, being a dos given by some third person other
than a male ascendant on the express condition that it should be restored
to him (dotis receptio) at the termination of the marriage. There could
be no dos unless the wedlock were lawful, ‘ neque enim dos sine matri-
monio esse potest ; ubicunque igitur matrimonii nomen non est, nec dos
est ’ Dig. 23. 3. 3, ‘ibi dos esse debet, ubi onera matrimonii sunt’ ib.
56. 1. Is the husband were a filiusfamilias, the dos went to his pater,
on whom the onera matrimonii fell. Anything could serve as dos
whereby the property of the husband (or os his pater) was augmented
—ownership, iura in re (e. g. usufruct)‚ rights in personam, or release of a
debt.

The modes of constituting a dos were three in number: dos aut datur,
aut dicitur, aut promittitur. ‘ Dotem dicere potest mulier, quae nuptura
est, et debitor mulieriS, si iussu eius dicat, institutus„ parens mulieris
virilis sexuS, per virilem sexum cognatione iunctuS, velut pater, avus
paternus: dare, promittere dotem omnes possunt' Ulpian, reg. 6. 1 and
2 ; cf. note on Bk. iii. 15. pr. inf. The general rule was that the dos ex-
isted, as such, only during the continuance of the marriage, and at its
termination must be restored to the woman or other person from whom
it proceeded, Dig. 24. 3. 2 ; but this might be modified by special agree-
ment, e. g. so as to give the husband a life interest. The latter became
owner os the dotal property, and so entitled to its absolute management:
‘si res in dotem dentur, pute, in bonis mariti fieri’ Dig. 23. 3. 7. 3; in
other passages, however, the wife’s reversion is recognised as strictly
qualisying the husband’s ownership: e. g. ‘quamvis in bonis mariti dos
sit, mulieris tamen est ' Dig. loc. cit. 74.

It was considered a matter οξ public interest to secure the return of
the dos at the termination of the marriage, as a provision sor the wife, or
in case she married a second time : ‘rei publicae interest, mulieres dotes
salvas habere, propter quas nubere possunt' Dig. 23. 3. 56. 1. The
husband often guaranteed this by stipulatiO, but apart from this there
was an action for recovery (dotis exactio, § 12 inf.) called actio rei
uxoriae, which was bonae fidei in character: for Justinian's changes in
this matter see Bk. iv. 6. 29 inf. The wife was also a privileged creditor
in case of the husband's insolvency, and the provisions of the lex Iulia
