Omne autem ius, quo utimur, vel ad personas pertinet vel 12
ad res vel ad actiones, ac prius de personis videamus. nam
parum est ius nosse, si personae, quarum causa statutum est,

DE IURE PERSONARUM.

Summa itaque divisio de iure personarum haec est, quod
omnes homines aut liberi sunt aut servi. Et libertas quidem 1
est, ex qua etiam liberi vocantur, naturalis facultas eius quod
cuique facere libet, nisi si quid aut vi aut iure prohibetur.
Servitus autem est constitutio iuris gentium, qua quis dominio 2

Constantine, and he decides it in the passage cited from the Code: a
custom can certainly abrogate a statute, but (he says) there is an excep-
tion to this general rule, if the statute itsels contains a provision that no
custom is to be allowed to grow up in future contrary to its tenor ; a pro·
vision addressed to the subject, and forbidding the custom itsels, not to
the sovereign, and forbidding the repeal of the statute.

For the permanence and immutability of natural law cs. Cicero de
Republ. iii. 22, Dig. 7. 5. 2. 1 ; 50. 17· 8. By such passages it is not
meant that it is always binding on the citizen, but that what is ‘natural ’
once is natural sor ever ; for, as Ulpian says, ‘ius civile [iuri naturali] non
per omnia servit’ Dig. 1. ι. 6. pr. Similarly Gaius, speaking os the quasi
usufruct mentioned in Bk. ii. 4. 2 inf„ remarks that though the authority
os the senate cannot overcome naturalis ratio, its commands are binding;
Dig. 7. 5. 2. 1.

Tit. 111. For the division of private law made in pr. see the Introduc-
tion to this Book.

ξ 1. Liberty does not require that one should be free to act against
the lava, ‘legum quum servi sumus, ut liberi esse possimus ’ Cicero pro
Cluentio 53. 146. cf. Persius, Sat. v. 89 ‘Liceat, iussit quodcunque vo—
luntaS, Excepto si quid Masuri [i.e. Sabinus' work on law] rubrica vetavit,’
Dio Chrysostom, or. 14 ὅσα μὴ ἀπείρηται ὑπὸ τῶν νόμων, μηδὲ προστέτακται,
ὁ περὶ τοῖπον ἔχων τὴν ἐξουσίαν τοῦ πράττειν ὣς βοῦλεται . . . ἐλεύθερος.

ξ 2. In respect of capacity of right, slavery is a condition of absolute
‘ rightlessness? A slave could have no rights against either his master
or any one else 3 and, remembering what has been said of the lega] mean-
ing of ‘person' in the Introduction to this Book, it follows that a slave
was not a ‘person ' at all : he had no caput, Tit. 16. 4 inf. The Roman
lawyers looked upon him as a ‘re5,' and applied to him, as an object
of property, the same rules which they laid down as to domestic animals;
so far as there is any difference of treatment it is due to the slave’s pos—
session of reason, so that (a) heis able to increase his master’s means by .
his intellectual as well as by his physical powers, and (b) by manumission
