Tit. 13.] DE EXCEPTJONJB vs, 579

agitur. Verbi gratia si metu coactus aut dolo inductus aut 1
errore lapsus stipulanti Titio promisisti, quod non debueras
promittere, palam est iure civili te obligatum esse et acti0,
qua intenditur dare te oportere, efficax est: sed iniquum est
te condemnari ideoque datur tibi exceptio metus causa aut
doli mali aut in factum composita ad impugnandam actionem.
Idem iuris est, si quis quasi credendi causa pecuniam stipu- 2

§L For the introduction of the exceptio quod metus causa by the
praetor Octavius see on Tit. 6. 33 supr. A person who had been induced
by intimidation to make any disposition (and not merely a contram, as
might hastily be inserted from the text3 see Gaius iv. 117) could either
bring the actio quod metus causa (Tit. 6. 27 supr.) by which he might
recover penal damages for any loss he had suffered, or he could repel
any action brought against him on the disposition by the exceptio (which,
however, was not necessary in bonae fidei actions, Cod. 4. 44. 8), or
finally he might get himself in integrum restitutus. With ‘ palam est iure
civili te obligatum esse’ in the text we may compare Dig. 4. 2. 21. 5 ‘ si
metu coactus adii hereditatem, puto heredem me effici, quamvis si liberum
esset noluissem, tamen coactus volui.’

What has been said os metus may, mutatis mutandis, be repeated of
dolus ; see the note on Tit. 6. 33 referred το. Here the fraud had to be
alleged specifically against the plaintiff in the exceptio ; ‘ et quidem
illud adnotandum est, quod specialiter exprimendum est, de cuius
dolo quis queratur, non in rem, “si in ea re nihil dolo malo factum est,”
sed sic “si in ea re nihil dolo malo actoris factum est ”⁵ Dig. 44. 4. 2. 1 3
cf. (of the actio doli) ‘in haec actione designari oportet cuius dolo
factum sit, quamvis in metu non sit necesse' Dig. 4. 3. 15. 3. Where to
‘ nihil dolo malo factum est' was added ‘ neque fiat ' (as in Gaius iv. 119)
the exceptio was said to be generalis,

lf the defendant’s plea was not one of the commonet kinds which had
received specific name5‚ it briefly stated the facts upon which he relicti,
and was then said to be in sactum composita: ‘in factum λέγεται ἐπειδὴ
διηγηματικῶς τὸ γινόμενον ὀντιτίθησιν’ Tbeophilus ; 80, ton, Gaius describes
formulae in sactum conceptae by saying ‘ nominato eo quod factum est ’
iv. 46; sor an example see fragm. Vat. 310 ‘si non donationis causa
mancipavi vel promisi me daturum.’ In a loose sort of way these excep·
tiones in factum were comprised under the exceptio doli : ‘generaliter
sciendum est ex omnibus in sactum exceptionibus doli oriri exceptionem,
quia dolo facit, quicunque id quod quaqua exceptione elidi potest petit ’
Dig. 44. 4. 2. 5. It may be, however, that the contrast is merely the
old one between in ius and in factum, the judge's attention being directed
in some exceptiones to a question merely of law (e. g. ‘si in ea re nihil
contra legem Cinciam factum sit ' fragm. Vat. 310) ; this, as Keller
remarks (civil Process ξ 35), would make most exceptions in factum.
