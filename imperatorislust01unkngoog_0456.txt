2 administraturus esset negotia. Tutores quoque, qui tutelae
iudicio tenentur, non proprie ex contractu obligati intelle-
guntur (nullum enim negotium inter ‘tutorem et pupillum
contrahitur): sed quia sane non ex ‘maleficio tenentur, quasi
ex contractu teneri videntur. et hoc autem casu mutuae sunt
actiones: non tantum enim pupillus cum tutore habet tutelae
actionem, sed et ex contrario tutor cum pupillo habet con-
trariam tutelae, si ve'l impenderit aliquid in rem ,pupilli vel
pro eo sue-rit obligatus aut rem suam creditori eius obligaverit.

3 Item si inter aliquos communis sit res sine societate, veluti
quod pariter eis legata donatave esset, et alter eorum alteri
ideo teneatur communi dividundo iudicio, quod solus fructus
ex ea re perceperit, aut quod socius-eius in eam -rem neces-
sarias impensas fecerit: non intellegitur proprie ex contractu
obligatus esse, quippe nihil inter se contraxerunt: sed quia
non ex maleficio tenetur, quasi ex contractu teneri videtur.

ξ 2. Cf. Bk. i. 20 supr. and note. The duties which the pupillus could
enforce against the guardian by actio tutelae directa were, in general,
those of maintaining the full value of his property, and to a certain
extent even of increasing it. The guardian was bound to keep it in
good order and condition, Cod. 5. 37. 22, 3 and 4, and to sell such parts
of it as were liable to spoil, Dig. ·26. 7. 7. 2 3 to call in all doubtful debts,
Dig. ib. 15 ; if the property consisted mainly of money, to lay it out on
land, ib. 3. 2, or at interest, ib. 7. 3 ; and if he used any os it for his own
purposeS, the rate of interest which he had to pay was the highest allowed
by law, ib. 7. 10 and 123 to duly conduct all necessary suits on the
ward’s behalf, ib. 1, 3 and 4, and in the discharge of all these duties to
exercise that degree of care which he showed in his own affairs, i. e. he
was answerable sor-culpa levis in concrete, Dig. 27. 1. 3. pr. This would
be of importance where -the ward was instituted -heir, or left a legacy or
fideicommissum, Cod. 5. 37. 21, Dig. 26. 7. 39. 3.

§ 3. This is called by the commentators communio incidens : cf. Dig.
17. 2. 21 ‘cum non affectione societatis incidimus in communionem.²
The rights and duties os the colegateeS, codoneeS, ete., inter se resemble
those of socii, sor which see on Tit. 2 5. >9 supr.

§ 4. Each of two or more coheredes, if they could not make a satis-
factory partition by agreement, could compel a judicial division os the
hereditas by the actio familiae erciscundae, in which the iudex also
adjusted all claims which each had acquired against the rest while their
coheir, (e. g. by paying debts, management, etc.), during which time their
rights and duties inter se are substantially the same as those of socii.
