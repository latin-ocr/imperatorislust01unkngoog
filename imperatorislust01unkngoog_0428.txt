practical incapacity of women to enter into contracts of this kind as
promisors. It seems to have originated in edicts of Augustus and
ClaudiuS, prohibiting wives from becoming sureties for their husband&
Dig. 16. 1. 2. pr. It is supposed, with considerable probability, that the
cause of the more general enactment, the Sc. Velleianum‚ ΑΔ). 64, was
recklessness with which women, after Claudius had abolished the tutela
legitima of agnates over them (p. 140 supr.), exercised their newly-sound
control of their property on behalf of others. This enacted that no action
should lie on contracts of suretyship entered into by women as promisors ς
‘ quod ad fideiussiones et mutui dationes pro aliis pro quibus interces-
serint feminae pertinet, tametsi ante videtur ita ius dictum esse, ne eo
nomine ab his petitio neve in eas actio detur, cum eas virilibus officiis
fungi et eius generis obligationibus obstringi non sit aequum ; arbitrari
senatum, recte atque ordine facturos ad quos de ea re in iure aditum erit,
si dederint operam ut in ea re senatus voluntas servetur' Dig. 16. 1. 2.
The senatusconsult thus related only to fideiussio and mutuum ; but its
principle was extended to all forms of intercessio, privative as well as
cumulative, by responsa of the jur-ists and imperial enactments, Dig.
loc. cit. 1. pr., ib. 2. 4 Though it had refused a remedy on such con-
tracts, it would seem that the usual practice was for the praetor to grant
the action, is applied for, which could then be met by the exceptio SC¹.
Velleiani, frequently mentioned in the textS, which could be pleaded
against execution even aster judgrnent had been given, Dig. 14. 6. 1 1. 1t
must not, however, be inferred from-this that the woman incurred even a
‘ natural’ obligation to pay the debt 3 for is she paid in ignorance os her
right to the excepti0, she could recover by condictio indebiti, Dig. 12. 6.
40. pr. Another view as to the history of the matter, in some degree
supported by the terms of the senatusconsult, is that women had been
forbidden to become sureties even by the old civil law, and that the
enactments of the time os Augustus and Claudius are merely evidence of

its evasion through the rapid decay of old Roman manners at the close
of the Republic.

There are a number of exceptions from the operation of the senatus-
consult, as e. g. where the woman had been guilty of dolus towards the
creditor, Dig. 16. 1. 2. 3, and where the latter, through no fault of his own,
was not aware that the person ‘ interceding’ was a woman, ib. 123 where
the intercessio was made for valuable consideration, Cod. 4. ²9· 23. pr. ς
where the debt for which she interceded was practically her own ; and
where the creditor was a minor and the principal debtor insolvent, Dig. 4.
4. 12.
