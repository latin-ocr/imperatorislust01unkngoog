convenerit, quamvis nondum pretium numeratum sit ac ne
arra quidem data suerit. nam quod arrae nomine datur,
argumentum est emptionis et venditionis contractae. sed
’ haec quidem de emptionibus et venditionibus, quae sine
scriptura consistunt, optinere oportetz nam nihil a nobis in
huiusmodi venditionibus innovatum est. in his autem quae
scriptura conficiuntur non aliter perfectam esse emptionem
et venditionem constituimuS, nisi et instrumenta emptionis
fuerint conscripta vel manu propria contrahentium, vel ab
alio quidem scripta, a contrahente autem subscripta et, si
per tabellionem fiunt, nisi et completiones acceperint et
fuerint partibus absoluta. donec enim aliquid ex his deest,
et poenitentiae locus est et potest emptor vel venditor sine
poena recedere ab emptione. ita tamen impune recedere eis
concedimus, nisi iam arrarum nomine aliquid suerit datum:
hoc etenim subsecuto, sive in scriptis sive sine scriptis venditio
celebrata est, is qui recusat adimplere contractum, si quidem
emptor est, perdit quod dedit, si vero venditor, duplum resti—

pretio esse potest. sed et certum pretium esse debet. alio—

Gaius iii. 139. By Cod. 4. 21. 17 Justinian made it the measure os a
penalty to be paid (additional, in unwritten contracts of sale, to specific
performance or damages as assessed by the judge) by the party who refused
to execute. Mr. Hunter (Roman Law p. 332) seems clearly to be wrong
in supposing that in a sale which the parties had not agreed to reduce to
writing the defaulter could escape scot free by forfeiting the arra which
he had given, or double that which he had received. He was subject to
the ordinary rule, and was bound from the moment the price was agreed
upon to do what he had promised. The effect os Justinian’s other
change was that, where the parties had agreed to reduce the contract to
writing, there was a locus poenitentiae, and therefore no obligati0, until
the document had been formally completed as required in this section‚
even though the terms and the price had been settled 3 but that is, in such
a case, arra had been given, and either party repudiated, he must, if
purchaser, forfeit his arra, and, is vendor, pay an equivalent sum besides
returning it.

§ 1. The price need not be absolutely fixed: e. g. it was sufficient to
