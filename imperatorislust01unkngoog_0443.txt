Tit. 25-] DE SOCIETA TE. 431

solum quod superest intellegatur lucri esse. Illud expeditum 3
est, si in una causa pars fuerit expressa, veluti in solo lucro
vel in solo damno, in altera vero omissa: in eo quoque quod
praetermissum est eandem partem servari. Manet autern 4
societas eo usque, donec in eodem consensu perseveraverint:
at cum aliquis renuntiaverit societati, solvitur societas. sed
plane si quis callide in hoc renuntiaverit societati, ut obveniens
aliquod lucrum solus habeat, veluti si totorum bonorum socius,
cum ab aliquo heres esset relictus, in hoc renuntiaverit
societati, ut hereditatem solus lucrifaceret, cogitur hoc lucrum

contradicted by Dig. 17. 2. 30 ‘ Mucius scribit, non posse societatem
coiri, ut aliam damni aliam lucri partem socius serat. Servius in notatis
Mucii ait nec posse societatem ita contrahi, neque enim lucrum intelle—
gitur, nisi omni damno deducto, neque damnum, nisi omni lucro
deducto; sed potest coiri societas ita, ut eius lucri, quod reliquum in
societate sit, omni damno deducte, pars alia seratur, et eius damni, quod
similiter relinquatur, pars alia capiatur.’ What Servius (Sulpicius) meant
in this passage was that, if Mucius' dictum be taken literally, it is true,
because in a partnership one cannot speak of lucrum and damnum, but
only of lucrum or damnum3 but if it be taken to mean that A and B
cannot become partners upon terms that, if the partnership transactions
end in a profit, A shall have Ἀ and B Ἀ, but that if they end in a loss A
shall bear Ἀ and B Ἄ, it is altogether untrue 3 though (as is implied in
the quia saepe, etc., os our text) such an arrangement is incompatible
with the rules of societas unless A contributes more, either money, skssl,
credit, management, etc., to the business· Sulpicius seems to have been
a keen critic of Mucius (Scaevola): ‘ Servius Sulpicius reprehensis Mucii
capitibus ’ Gen. 4 1.

So too it was allowable for Α to share in profitS, but not in losseS, only
is he did more for the partnership in some way or other than B, Dig. 17.
2. 29. 1 ; but the converse agreement, that A should help to bear the
loss, but should have no share in the profits (called leonina societas from
Phaedrus 1. 5) was void: ‘iniquissimum enim genus est, ex quo quis
damnum, non etiam lucrum spectet’ Dig. ib. 29. 2. The reason why
such a transaction is invalid as societas is stated in Dig. ²4 1. 3²· 24
‘nulla societas est, quae donationis causa interponitur3’ though it will
stand as a gift, if so intended, and the rules governing such dispositions
(p. 223 supr.) are complied with. 1f the shares in lucrum and damnum
were lest to be fixed by one of the partners themselves (Dig. 17. 2. 6), or
by a third person (ib. 76-80), it was assumed that the decision would be
that of a vir bonus: ‘unde, si arbitrium ita pravum est, ut manifesta
iniquitas eius appareat, corrigi potest per iudicium bonae fidei’ Dig.
