it, was naturally not backward in calling his master's attention to this
imperfection. Justinian, therefore, in As). 534, appointed a new com-
mission‚ consisting of Tribonian, as president, and four otherS, to revise
the Code of ΑΒ. 529. within a few months the latter, and also the
constitutions issued after its enactment, were deprived of all authority,
and withdrawn from circulation, their place being taken by a new Code,
known as the ‘ codex repetitae praelectionis,' in which were incor-
porated Justinian’s own constitutionS, as well as many others which
the earlier Code had not contained: some again which had stood in
the latter were now omitted, and there were numerous alterations and
interpolations, Tribonian sparing no pains to make the revision as
complete as possible. The codex repetitae praelectionis was promul-
gated on Nov. 16, 534, with statutory force from the ensuing 29th of
December. It consisted of twelve bookS, and in arrangement followed
very closely the order of the Digest.

The adversaries of codification have made great capital out of an
error into which its advocates have sometimes fallen, and which con·
sists in supposing that a good Code dispenses with the necessity of
any further legislation 3 they have even accused Justinian of believing
thatin his three great bodies of law was summed up the perfection
of human wisdom, and that they would suffice, without addition or
alteration, to determine for all time the rights and duties of his sub-
jects. It is quite certain that Justinian never believed anything of the
kind. His main purpose had been to set the law upon a solid foun-
dation, and to cast it in a form which his successors would not lightly
venture to alter; by the completeness of his work he hoped to endow
his subjects with the inestimable blessing of a legal system pruned of
all relics of antiquity‚ adequate in substance, and so judiciously ar-
ranged as to reduce the necessity of future change to a minimum.
But within five years to have entirely recast a large portion of his own
work might well arouse the suspicion, that the law had lost all its old
stability ; that the legislature had become too active3 that as the first
Code had been thrust aside to make room for a second, so the second
would soon be swept away in favour of a third, and that in the confu-
sion which such constant change could not fail to produce the many-
sided security which all law is intended to guarantee would cease to
exist. In his publication of the codex repetitae praelectionis Justinian
deemed it necessary to disarm all fear of such a tendency. He ex-
pressly recognised the probability, if not the necessity, of subsequent
change, and enacted that constitutions issued after the publication of
the Code should be formed into a distinct collection, under the title of
