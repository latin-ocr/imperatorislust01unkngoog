⁶ ἒ5) Actual enjoyment of the right for a prescribed period of time.
Where a praedium was acquired by usucapio (Tit. 6 inf.)‚ the servitudes
appurtenant to it were acquired along with it ς but apart and by them-
selves, such rights could not thus arise, for usucapio presupposes pos-

session of the thing to be acquired, and a bare right cannot be possessed : ·

‘ hoc iure utimur, ut servitutes per se nusquam longo tempore capi
possint, cum aedificiis possint’ Dig. 41. 3. 103 cf. Dig. 8. 1. 14. lt would
seem, however, that at one time this principle was not fully admitted, for
a lex Scribonia of uncertain date (Dig. 41. 3. 4. 29) forbade usucapion of
servitudes, except the anomalous class spoken of on § 1 supr. ; but it is
now very commonly held that though rustic servitudes could never be
acquired by usucapi0, urban could, as in them there is a greater sem-
blance of uninterrupted possession than in the former, and that the lex
Scribonia related to the urban class only.

Servitudes over provincial soil, however, could be acquired by an
analogous institution of praetorian origin, more fully explained in Ex-
cursus 111 at the end os this Book, viz. longa quasi-possessio, actual
exercise of the right for ten years is the owner os the praedium serviens
lived in the same province, twenty is in another3 Dig. 7. 5. 10. This
mode of acquisition came gradually to be recognised in Italy also, so
that in effect the lex Scribonia lost much os its force: under Justinian it
is in full operation for all kinds of servitudes, its conditions being (a)
uninterrupted enjoyment of the right for the periods specified, which (b)
must not be violent, or without the knowledge of the other party, or in
virtue of express permission from him; but bona fides does not seem
necessary; Dig. 8. 6. 243 43. 2ο. 1. 10.

Servitudes generally might be extinguished in the following ways :—

(1) Destruction of the res serviens (Tit. 4. 3 inst), or its withdrawal
from commercium. Personal servitudes perished also if the res serviens
underwent a complete and essentia] transformation, Dig. 7. 4. 5. 2 and 3.

(2) Confusio (which when the usufruct merged in the proprietas was
called specially consolidatio, Tit. 4. 3 inf.), i. e. the dominium and the
servitude becoming vested in one and the same person. This occurred
frequently in succession upon death.

(3) Release of the right to the dominus of the res serviens, Tit 4. 3
inf. Τὴε proper form of release had originally been in iure cessio and
for rustic servitudes in Italy probably also mancipatio: in Justinian's
time a mere agreement (cessio or concessio) was sufficient without any
formal surrender. There is some ground sor supposing that abandon-
ment (derelictio) extinguished usufruct, though not other servitudes;
but its effect seems really to have been to terminate, not the usufruc-
tuary’s rights, but only his liabilities.
