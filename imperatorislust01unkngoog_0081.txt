THE SYSTEM OF PRIVATE LAW. 69

perform the act which he is bound to perform in favour of another,

the law will condemn him to pay pecuniary damages, the obligation
being thus transformed into ownership (of money): (b) the object of

the vast majority of obligations is the acquisition or the transitory en-

joyment os dominion. But, secondly, one man may be related to
another as being, along with him, a member of the organic whole,
humanity. In obligation a person is regarded as an individual atom,
standing apart by himself ; here he is regarded as a being incomplete,
and finding his completeness in the great interconnection of nature.
This is especially observable in two points: (a) the distinction of the
sexes, whose incompleteness is perfected in marriage: and (b) the
limited duration of human life3 and here the deficiency is supplied by
the perpetuation of the race, which leads us to the idea of the periods
of human life, infancy, puberty, manhood, etc„ and the connected
theme of education, with the control of one person by another which
this irnplieS. These are grouped together under the idea os parental
power, with which is intimately connected the notion of kinship.
M arriage, parental power, and kinship form together a department of
the private code which we may call family law.

We can thus picture to ourselves three concentric eirctes, within
which the human will can exercise its supremacy: (i) The original
sels, the scr-called rights to which are not, according to Savigny, pro-
perly subjects of jurisprudence. (ii) The sels expanded in the family;
the legal relations comprised under this belonged to family law.
(iii) The external world apart from the family; the rights which arise
from the relations to this of the individual will belong to property
law. in its two departments‚ law of thingS, and law of obligations.
Though however the field of private law has thus been mapped out
into three great departmentS, family law, law of things, and law of
obligations, with their three great corresponding classes of rightS,
these can be thus sharply separated only in absh-action, and a further
development is accordIngly desirable in two directions. Firstly‚ the
rights and duties which arise from many legal relations seem to belong,
for some reasons, to family law, for others to the law of property3 that
is to say, there are some forms of ownership and of obligation which
cannot exist apart from the family, and which in fact are of supreme
importance in investing the family with a jural character. In the
Roman law, for instance, the institutione os dos, donatio propter
nuptiaS, peculium, patronatus, and the contractual relations enforced
by the ⁶ actiones adiectitiae qualitatis ⁸ are of this character. Legal
relations of this kind may with convenience be classed by themselves
