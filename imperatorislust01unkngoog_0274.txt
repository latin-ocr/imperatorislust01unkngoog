institution of customary law. Where a paterfamilias instituted as his
heir his impubes filiusfamilias (or one not yet born, postumuS, ξ 4
inf„ Dig. 28. 6. 2. pr.), he could substitute to the latter so as to meet
not only the event of his predeceasing him himself, and so not becoming
heir at all, but also that of his becoming heir, and then dying before he
reached puberty: and even if he ‘disinherited the child, he could appoint
a substitutus to him in the event of his dying impubeS, to take any
property which he might himself acquire between his becoming sui iuris
and his death. The object of the practice in either case was clearly to
save the child from dying intestate: not being able, ex hypothesi, to
make a valid will for himself, his paterfamilias was allowed to make one
sor him, § 2, which became void eo instanti that he himself acquired
testamentary capacity, § 8. The differences between this and vulgar
substitution are clear at a glauce. The latter operates only if the in·
stitutus fails to take the inheritance: if he once acceptS, the contingent
right of the substitutus falls to the ground. But pupillary substitution is
not necessarily made to an institutus at all: it may be made to a dis-
inherited child 3 and even if the child as a fact is instituted, and actually
takes the inheritance, the substitution may still operate, and will, if the
heres dies under the age of puberty.

If the pupillariter substitutus was himself instituted, jointly with the
child, to the inheritance and refused it, he could not take under the
substitution : conversely, his acceptance of it was an implicit acceptance
of the child's inheritance in case he became entitled‚ Dig. 28. 6. 10. 3,
Cod. 6. 30. 20.

A pupillary substitution became void not only on the child’s attaining
puberty, but also by his dying or otherwise passing out of potestas
during the father-'s lifetime‚ and by his falling on the pater-'s death under
the potestas of another, though not by his subsequent adrogation, Dig.
1. 7. 17. 1.

§ 1. This quasi pupillaris or exemplaris substituti0, as it is commonly
called, was, as a general right, a new creation of Justinian, and was quite
independent of patria potestas, being allowed to ascendants of either
sex, Cod. 6. 26. 9 ε but in their choice of a successor to the mente captus

· they were limited, in the first instance, to descendants of the latter, in
the second, to descendants of their own; in default of both they might
select whom they pleased: this is the meaning of ‘ certas personas’ in
the text. ln general the mles of substitutio pupillaris applied. By
