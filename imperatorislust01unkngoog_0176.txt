DE EXCUSATIONIBUS.

Excusantur autem tutores vel curatores variis ex causis:
plerumque autem propter liberoS, sive in potestate sint sive
emancipati. si enim tres liberos quis superstites Romae
habeat vel in Italia quattuor vel in provinciis quinque, a tutela
vel cura possunt excusari exemplo ceterorum munerum: nam
et tutelam et curam placuit publicum munus esse. sed
adoptivi liberi non prosunt, in adoptionem autem dati naturali
patri prosunt. item nepotes ex filio prosunt, ut in locum
patris succedant, ex filia non prosunt. filii autem superstites
tantum ad tutelae vel curae muneris excusationem prosunt,
defuncti non prosunt. sed si in bello amissi sunt, quaesitum
est, an prosint. et constat eos solos prodesse qui in acie
amittuntur: hi enim, quia pro re· publica ceciderunt, in

or cura were secured against loss from the dishonesty or negligence of
their tutors or curators. They were also protected (1) by the possibility
of remotiO, Tit. 26 inf. (2) By statutory restrictions on the tutor’s or
curator’s powerS, especially in respect of alienation: see on Tit. 13. 1
supr. (3) By a statutory hypothes over the tutor’s or curator’s whole
property, which had certainly been established as early as the time of
Constantine, Cod. 5. 37. 20. (4) By responsibility of other persons for
the tutor or curator (in addition to his sureties and the appointing magis-
trate). These were the affirmatores, who had at the inquisitio borne
witness to the character of the person appointed, and the nominatores‚
persons who proposed or suggested a tutor or curator in any particular
case3 this might happen (a) at the petitio tutoris. Is a pupil had no
tutor, anyone could apply sor or suggest one, and some persons were
bound to do this: e. g. the mother (Bk. iii. 3. 6 inf.), and other heirs
presumptive ab intestato, under penalty, in default, of forfeiting their
rights of succession if the pupil died impubes, Dig. 26. 6. 2. 2: also the
libertus, under a pecuniary penalty, Dig. 16. 2. 1. (b) In cases where a
man was appointed tutor or curator by a magistrate, he could usually
procure exemption by suggesting some one better qualified (potioris
nominatio) by reason of relationship. This right os nominatio was in
many cases restricted <fx-agra Vat. 158, Paul. rec. sent. 2. 29 ‘ qui
potiores nominare non possunt ’), and was altogether abolished by Jus-
‚tiniam

¹1¹1t. XXV. For the Eastern Empire Romae means Constantinople,
and Italia Thrace, schol. Theoph. By ‘ut in patris locum succedant’
is meant that any number of grandchildren by one dead son count only
as one: ὅσοι δ’ ἃν ὦσιν ἔγγονοι ἐξ ἰνὸς υἱοῦ, ἀντὶ ἑνὸς τὲκνου ἆριθμοῦνται, Dig.
