of real rightS, or the communication of their exercise and enjoyment ¹.
This coordination however of obligations with rights in rem is re·
garded by the Austinian school as an egregious error of arrangement,
on the ground that the distinction between rights, according as they
are real or personal, is a radical one sor purposes of classification:
yet it is adopted by the continental writers on Roman law, who sub-
divide Vermogensrechn or Proper-ty law, into Sachenrecht, com·
prising ownership, possession, and iura in re aliena, and the law of
obligationS‚ whether arising ex contractu or ex delict0. Indeed‚ the
very treatment of contracts and delicts together, as facts or events
from which obligations arise‚ is considered faulty by Mr. Hunter,
because, as he allegeS‚ the sole connection between them was that
they formed two subdivisions of actiones in personam. ‘ In the state-
ment of claim it was alleged that the defendant ought to do or pay
· something. In an action, then, upon a contract or delict, the for-
mulae were very similar, while both stood in marked contrast to the
formula in an actio in rem. It is easy to understand, therefore, why
the Roman writers included contract and delict under the common
designation of obligatio' (Roman Law, Introduction p. xxxvi). It is
not however the action, but the right which the action is designed
to enforce, to which attention should be directed; and whether a
man refuses to perform his contract, or violates a right in rem, the
right which arises from the refusal or the violation is a right in per-
sonam. It may be replied that this involves a confusion between
antecedent and remedial rights: but this is a purely party objection
which Gaius could not have been expected to answer. On the other
hand, Mr. Hunter may himself be met by the charge that he regards
contracts from the wrong point of view. A contract may be analysed
into two elementa the agreement or promise, and the obligation, which
is annexed to it by law. Now Roman and modern law differ as
regards the importance which they respectively attribute to these two
elements: the former bringing the obligation into the foreground,
the latter rather dwelling on the consensus of the parties. Yet the
Roman view here seems to be strictly correct and lawyer-like, for a
promise without an obligation, such as English lawyers call a nudum
pactum, is in the eye of the law non-existent, while an obligation has
an independent legal existence; it is the obligation, consequently,
which for legal purposes should be deemed of primary importance,
and constituted a summum genus for purposes of classification. If
contracts are not to stand isolated and out of all connection with
