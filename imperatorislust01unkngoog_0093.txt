INTRODUCTION To BOOK Ῑ. 81

were plentiful, and the distinctive features of the civil law were still
sufficiently prominent to place thern at some disadvantage in respect
of conveyance, contract‚ and civil procedure3 the ‘ius commercii '
was still a privilege. We thus might have reasonably expected to find
in Gaius the sentence ‘ rursus liberorum hominurn alii cives sunt, alii
peregrini ;’ but it is not there, and the omission, it must be allowed,
is a grave flaw in the view which we have taken of the ‘ius quod ad
personas pertinet? Still, it is equally to be accounted sor on most
other theories of the meaning of the phrase, and perhaps the best
explanation which can be offered is that, as the difference between
civis and peregrinus is merely that the former had, while the latter
had not, the commercium and connubium, the distinction is a bare
one, of which little can be said except in the ‘ius quod ad res ' or ‘ad
actiones pertinet,’ under the heads of property, contract‚ and pro-
cedure. It is true that in the time of Gaius there were certain inter-
mediate classes, dediticii and Latini Iuniani, which might have been
mentioned or described in this connection3 but Gaius had already
spoken os these, though perhaps less logically, under the head of
manumission; so that to omit the distinction of civis and peregrinus
was excusable, because it would have led to a repetition and to diffi-
culties os arrangement. And it may, lastly, be observed that the ius
personarum was but little affected by the praetorian innovations 3 it ναξ,
in the main, pure ius civile ς and if we may believe that Gaius' inten-
tion was under this head to describe the classes of persons who, iure
civili, possessed a status, the peregrini did not form one of these
classes, and therefore the bare distinction between them and cives did
not require notice. ‘ Tuitione praetoris’ they might possess rights;
‘ iure civili: however, they were unimportant.

There remains the status familiae, and the discussion of this
occupies the really greater portion of the first book of the Institutes.

It is introduced in connection with the distinction of persons into
independent (sui iuris) and dependent (alieni iuris) (Title 8). Exclud-
ing the form of dependency found in slaver'y, which has been already
treated, the only mode in which such subjection still existed in
Justinian's time was the patria potestas (Title 9) ; and the various
ways in which this may originate are described. These are (1)
marriage, in connection with which a tolerably rull account is in-
directly given of the grades of consanguinity, apropos to the degrees
within which it is forbidden to marry. As bearing closely on the law
os intestate succession, the same subject is more explicitly treated in
Bk. iii. Title 6. (2) Adoption‚ in its two forms adrogation and adoption
