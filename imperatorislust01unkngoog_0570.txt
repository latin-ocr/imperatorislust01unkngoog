5 Ceterum dubium non est, quin is quoque, qui iussu domini
contraxerit cuique institoria vel exercitoria actio ,competit
de peculio deque eo, quod in rem domini versum est, agere
possit: sed erit stultissimuS, si omissa actione, qua facillime ²
solidum ex contractu consequi possit, se ad difficultatem
perducat probandi in rem domini vasum esse, vel haben: l
servum peculium et tanturn habere, ut solidum sibi solvi
possit. Is quoque, cui tributoria actio competit, aeque de
peculio et in rem verso agere potest: sed sane huic modo

5. Here the creditor is enabled to sue the dominus by the actio de
peculio et in rem verso, in which two questions usually lie sor the judge²s
consideration 3 (1) has the master himself derived any material advantage
· from the contract in question? No stress can bere be laid on the lang-:age
of the text above, which suggests that the dominus was liable only if the
expenditure of the slave upon his affairs was necessary (necessario . . .
rem necessariam) 3 in Dig. 15. 3. 3. 2 and 4 ; ib. 5. pr. and 2 expenditur-e
which is utilis, and in 3. 4 of the same Title an outlay which merely ‘ ad
voluptatem domini spectat ’ is said to be recoverable hyde in rem verso ;
and in fact this action lay wherever actio mandati or negotiorum
gestorum would lie .- ‘ et regulariter dicimus totiens de in rem verso esse
actionem, quibus casibus procurator mandati, vel qui negotia gessit, nego-
tiorum gestorum haberet actionem, quotiensque aliquid consumsit servus
ut aut meliorem rem dominus habuerit, aut non deteriorem ’ Dig. 15. 3. 3.
2. If in rem versio in this sense oould be established, the master‘s own
means were liahle pro tant03 and the advantage which he had derived
Ι might have been so great that the creditor might conceivably obtain
full payment in this manner, as e.g. where the slave had horrowed 501,
and spent the whole of it in paying his master's deth. But (2) if the
master ‚has derived no material benefit from the slave’s conti-act, or at
least not enough to make him liable to the creditor in solidum, the judge
has to inquire into the amount of the slave’s peculium (deducting the
master's own claims against it), and to condemn the dominus to pay the
creditor from it what is due to him, so sar as it extends at the date os the
condemnation, Dig. 15. ι. 30. pr. The master’s liability to de peculio
lasted for an annus utilis after the slave was alienased or manumittess
Dig. 15. 2. The reason why thedominus here enjoyed the privilege,
which he did not possess under the circumstances described in ξ 3 supr„
of paying his own claims against the slave from the peculium in fun, was
the fact that here the contract had in no way been sanctioned by him.

For vicarii servi see on Bk. ii. 20. 17 supr. ‘ ld, quod ipsis (sc. vicariis)
debet ordinarius servus, non >deducetur de peculio ordinarii servi, quia
peculium eorum in peculio ipsius est :³ cs. Theophilus, ἵνα μὴ τὸ αὐτὸ
πρόσωπον εὑρεθῇ δύο ἐνέπω ποιοῦν, καὶ ηὖξον καὶ &romania τὸ peculium.
