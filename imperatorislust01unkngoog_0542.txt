adigestorum libris opportunius apparebit. Sed istae quidem
actiones, quarum mentionem habuimus, et si quae sunt similes,
ex legitimis et civilibus causis descendunt. aliae autern sunt,
quas praetor ex sua iurisdictione comparatas habet tam in
rem quam in personam, quas et ipsas necessarium est exemplis
ostendere. ecce plerumque ita permittit in rem agere, ut vel
actor diceret se quasi usu cepisse, quod usu non ceperit, vel ex
diverso possessor diceret adversarium suum usu non cepisse quod

· 4 usu ceperit. Namque si cui ex iusta causa res aliqua tradita
suerit, veluti ex causa emptionis aut donationis aut dotis aut
legatorum, necdum eius rei dominus effectus est, si eius rei

relate see Bk. ii. 3—5 and notes supr. Τὴε actio -consessoria‚ affirming
a right of servitude in the plaintiff, lay not only against the dominus of
the res serviens, bnt against any one by whom the right was violated, and
its objects were recognition os the right and damages for its infringe-
ment : in form-it was arbitraria (ξ 31 infi). In many cases. especially of
praedial servitudes, the person entitled was not limited to this remedy,
but could use an interdict, and thereby compel the domium, if he wished ‘
to contest the right, to bring the actio negatoria. By this he asserted
the freedom os his property from the servitude affirmed by the other; its
object being-restoration of the property itself (if the other claimed a use
or usufruct) or cessation of the act by which the rights of ownership had
been interfered with ; damages sor what had been done, and security by
stipulation against its repetition. For these actions generally cf. Mr.
Poste‘s note on Gaius iv. 3.

The single case referred to at the end os the section, in which a
possessor can be plaintiff in a real action, and of which justinian says
fuller information may be found in the Digest, may be either where a
person, though not ceasing to ‘possess' his property, has given it as
precarium to another, Dig. 43. 26. 15. 4 : or where one person possesses
ex iusta causa (i. e. as dominus) and another vi aut clam, but not from
him (so that the interdict Uti possidetis does not lie), Dig. 43. 17. 3. pr.;
or where a civil possessor brings vindicatio against another who has
detention in his name, Dig. 6. 1. 9 ; 7. 9. 7. pr.

§ 3. For the history os the distinction here drawn between actiones
civiles or legitimae, and actiones honorariae (the latter comprising the
two classes os utiles and in factum) see Excursus X. Actiones honorariae
in rem are exemplified in §§ 3-7‚ in personam in §§ 8-12 inf.

By possessor at the end of this section can only be meant ‘is qui olim
possederat ' (referring to § 5 inf.), cf. domino for ‘ ei qui dominus suerat'
in ξ 5, and Dig. 41. 1.56. 13 27. 3. 13. 4.
