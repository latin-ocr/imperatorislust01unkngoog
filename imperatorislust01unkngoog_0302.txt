290 INST I T UT JONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. 11.

stitutionem incertus dari debeat, quia certo iudicio debet quis
28 pro tutela suae posteritati cavere. Postumus autem alienus
heres institui et antea poterat et nun'c potest, nisi in utero
eius sit, quae iure nostra uxor esse non potest. ·Si quid in
29 nomine cognomine praenomine legatarii erraverit testator, si
de persona constat, nihilo minus valet legatum: idem in

Tit. 14. pr. supr. The constitution by which Justinian altered the law is
not in the Code which has come down to uS, but there is a statement of
its contents in the abstract of the Basilica made by one Tipucitus.

ξ 28. What Justinian says as to the possibility of instituting 'a postumus
alienus before his own time refers (as is clear from Bk. iii. 9. pr. inf.) not
to the validity of such institution iure civili, but to the resulting bonorum
possessio z cf. Gaius ii. 242, 287. For the latter part of the section ef.
Gaius ii. ¹4¹ ‘ item'qui in utero eius est quae connubio non interveniente ’
ducta est' uxor extraneus postumus patri contingit ’ and Dig. 28. 2. 9. 1
‘sed si ex ea, quae alii nupta sit, postumum quis heredem instituerit,
ipso iure non valet, quod turpis sit instituti0,’ ib. 4 ‘sed si per adop-
tionem sororem factam habeam, potero postumum ex ea heredem in-
stituere, quia adoptione soluta possum eam ducere uxorem)

ς 89. Mistake is of two kinds: it may exist either in forming an in·
tention, or in expressing one already genuinely formed. In this and the
next section Justinian is speaking of the latter. An error in a name, si de
persona constat, does not affect the validity of a testamentary disposition,
‘rerum enim vocabula immutabilia sunt, hominurn mutabilia’Di'g. 30.
4 pr. Again, if a testator expressed a different quantity from‘what he
intended, the expression must yield to the intention, Dig. 28. 5. 9..2—4;
30.15.· and if he inserted a condition which he never intended, it was
taken pro non script0, Dig. 28. 5. 5: buta disposition which in form is
absolute, but which the testator intended to make conditional, is void, Dig.

’ 28· 5· 9 5- -

A disposition made under a mistake, or in ignotance of certain facts
(the first kind of mistake above mentioned) as a rule has all the effect
which it would have had, had there been no mistake at all. In wills,
however, this rule 5 reversed, and the disposition is void. Thus, if a

· testator institutes or gives a legacy to a person whom he erroneously
believes to be his son or brother, the institution or legaey is invalid‚ Cod.
6. 23. 5 ; 6. 24. 4., 7 : so too if he institutes an extraneus supposing that
he has no children of his own, Dig. 5. 2. 28, or executes a second will
under the impression that the person instituted in the first is dead,
Dig. 28. 5. 92. According to this rule, the master of the instituted slave

in Tit· 15- 4 supr.. would. becntitled to nothing, but the decision of -

TiberiuS, though quite opposed to principle, is to be excused. as a rough
and ready attempt to adjust a conflict between equitable and strictly
legal claimS. The inconsistency between §§ 4 and 11 has been pointed
out in the note on the latter.
