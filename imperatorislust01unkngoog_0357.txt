Tit. 1.] DE HEREDIT A T IBUS, ET C. 345 ·

signata partis tertiae deminutione vocat. Sed nOS, cum adhuc 16
dubitatio manebat inter adgnatos et memoratos nepotes,
partem quartam defuncti substantiae adgnatis sibi vindi-
cantibus ex cuiusdam constitutionis auctoritate, memoratam
quidem constitutionem a nostro codice segregavimus neque
inseri eam ex'Theodosiano codice in eo concessimus. nostra
autem constitutione promulgata toti iuri eius derogatumest:
et sanximus ’talibus nepotibus ex filia vel pronepotibus ex
nepte et deinceps superstitibus adgnatos nullam partem
mortui successionis sibi vindicare, ne hi, qui ex transversa
linea veniunt, potiores his habeantur, qui recto iure de-
scendunt. quam constitutionem nostram optinere secundum
sui vigorem et tempora et nunc sancimus: ita tamen ut,
quemadmodum inter filios et nepotes ex filio antiquitas statuit
non in capita sed in stirpes dividi hereditatem, similiter nos
inter filios et nepotes ex filia distributionem fieri iubemuS, vel

the old law had stood next after the sui, as being patron (Tit. 7 infi).

, Gratian and later emperors preferred the children of an emancipated

daughter (who os course neither were nor ranked as sui) to the parens
manumissor, Cod. Theod. 5. 1. 3 ε Anastasius allowed family rights to be
reserved in emancipation by imperial rescript, Cod. 6. 58. 1 1 ε see on Bk. i.
12. 6 supr. Thtough Justinian's abolition of the old form of emancipation
the pater’s rights of succession, qua patron, and the connected bonorum
possesio unde decem personae (Tit. 9. 4 ins.) disappeared, and in his
system the order of succession to an emancipatus is, first, liberi, second,
the pater, Bk. i. 12. 6 supr. ς Tit. 9. 4 ins. If, however, the deceased left
surviving him, besides the pater, a mother and brothers or sisterS, the
proprietas belonged to the brothers or sisters, the usufruct in thirds to
them, the father and the mother respectively: if he lest no mother, but
brothers or sisters as well as the pater, the latter had the usufruct, the
former the proprietaS, of the whole.

Under Justinian consequently (before the changes effected by N ov. 1 18,
for which see on Tit. 9. 9. inf„ and omitting the cases of filiusfamilias and
emancipatus just considered), the following personS, though owing their
respective titles historically to different legislative organr», ranked in the
first class as successors on an intestacy, viz. sui (Twelve Tables), liberi
(Edict), and grandchildren by a deceased daughter (Cod. Theod. 5. 1. 4).
1f the deceased were a woman, as she could have no sui or liberi in the
technical sense, there was, strictly speaking, no first class to succeed her:
the first right belonged to her children by the SC. Orfitianum, Tit. 4 infi,
and to -grandchildren by issue deceased, all of whom the Romans them-
selves rank in the second class as legitimi ς see the next Title.
