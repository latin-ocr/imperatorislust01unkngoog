IUS HONORARI UM--T HE EMPJRE. 39

the peculiarities of the civil law—formality, exclusiveness, rigidity; they
are liberal, equitable, fitted to endure through all time3 and these are
based upon the ius gentium, or rather upon the natural sense of right,
the naturalis aequitas, in which the Romans recognised that law's
internal and generative principle. The ius gentium and the ius hono-
rarium or praetorium (for practical purposes the expressions are
nearly synonymous) thus require to be distinguished, and their relation
to one another ascertained. The distinction of ius civile and ius
honorarium is based on the difference of the organs to whose activity
they respectively owed their existence; that of ius civile and ius gen-
tium on differences of nature and os extension. The two would have
corresponded exactly if the whole ius gentium had been taken up into
the urban edict, and the latter had contained no other law whatsoever;
but as a matter of fact, though there is a very intimate relation between
them, rules could and did belong to the one without also belonging to
the other. Still, the most important portion of the rules enunciated
in the edict can be traced to the ius gentium, which indeed was the
clement in it which gave it such an honour-able prominence among the
sources of the positive law of Rome. Hence the common opposition,
to which attention has been already drawn, between the ius praeto-
rium and the ius civile. Yet not unfrequently the former is reckoned
part of the latter, or rather the edicta magistratuum are enumerated
among its sources (e. g. Cic. Top. 5), though it is far more usual to
find them contrasted (as in Dig. 28. 1. 2 3 ‘testamentum utroque
iure valebit, tam civili quam praetorio ’). The contrast was in part a
material one 3 the civil law was ‘ proprium civitatis nostrae,’ whereas
the greater part of the ius praetorium was derived from the ius gen-
tium, and therefore its validity extended itself beyond the limits of the
Roman state into all nations which were under the rule os law. But
in part, as has been remarked above, it arose from the difference of
the organs through which the civil and the praetorian law respectively
came into existence. A rule of the ius praetorium had no validity
other than that which could be given it by the praetor by whom it
was issued3 it did not bind his successors or even his official col-
leagues ; its force was far less, both in duration and in universality,
than that of a lex enacted by the sovereign populus. Rights conferred
in the latter way were necessarily protected by the praetor at all times,
but they existed apart from and independently of hirn3 rights con-
serred by the edict depended purely and simply on his good saith3
thus (Dig. 7. 4. ι) ‘ usus fructus iure constitutus ’ is opposed to ‘usus
fructus tuitione praetoris constitutus ;’ and it was through this formally
