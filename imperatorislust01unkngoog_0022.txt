10 INTRODUCTION.

mine of gunpowder is harmless unless there be some one to apply
the match3 and the practica] helplessness of the plebeians will be
comprehended if we remember three facts. In the first place, no
citizen could constitutionally bring any matter before the centun‘es
except one or other of the consuls. In the second place, the senate
still preserved its probouleutic function already described3 that is to
say, even a consul could not submit a single question to the comitia
until it had previously been discussed by the senate, and its reference
to the larger assembly had been approved by that body. Thirdly, it
was required that all elective or legislative acts which needed a re-
ligious sanction should be confirmed by a lex curiata in the comitia

of that name, in which it will be remembered that patricians alone
were entitled to take part; such confirmation was essential, for in-
stance, to the validity of consular elections, for on consuls a lex
curiata alone could confer the imperium, and of all alterations in the
constitution.

The first secession of the plebs (mc. 494) seems to have been
occasioned principally by financial distress. Unsuccessful wars
against the allies of the royal family of the Tarquins had
largely increased taxation, and taxation fell in the main on the
plebeians alone. The story of Athens in the time of Solon was once
more repeated. The patricians availed themselves os their com-
parative freedom from financial burdens to cast the net of usury
round the plebS, and the severe forrn of execution in vogue for debt
was abused for political purposeS. Returning from a campaign, the

’ plebeian section of the host occupied a hill in the vicinity of Rome,

subsequently known as the Mons Sacer, and refused to re-enter the
city. There they were joined by the rest of the plebS, and threats
uttered of a permanent secession, and of the establishment of an
opposition state. The patricians saved themselves from a catastrophe
which would have thrown the history of Rome centuries backward‚
and, in all probability, totally altered its character, by conceding
certain reforms, by surrendering certain of their privileges. To begin
with, the comitia tributa received a new substantive character.
Hitherto we should suppose it to have been little more than a means
of evoking an expression of plebeian opinion; its resolutions or
plebiscita had had no general authority, and had perhaps only served
to indicate to the patricians the temper of the political opposition and
the line of policy which party exigencies rendered expedient. It
would seem now that the tribus rusticae received a political influence
independent of the city tribes; at least, the total number of tribes
