Tit. 1.] DE OBLIGATIONIBUS QUAE, ETC. 499

est admittere. Furtum autern vel a furvo id est nigro dictum 2
est, quod clam et obscure fit et plerumque nocte: vel a
fraude: vel a ferendO, id est auferendo: vel a Graeco sermone,

θ qui φῶρας appellant fures. immo etiam Graeci ἀπὸ τοῦ φέρειν

φῶρας dixerunt. F'urtorum autem genera duo sunt, mani· 3

different species of theft (for of these there are but tw0, ξ 3 infi), but to
suggest the comprehensive character of the delict, and the chief forms
which the contrectatio might take. Its meaning in effect is this: the
general character of furtum consists in intentionally dealing with a res
mobilis in a wrongful manner, and usually the res is aliena, whether the
intention be to appropriate ownership in it (ipsius rei) or merely to use it
in an unauthorized manner (usus); but it is possible to commit thest on
property of one’s own, though to do this it is as a rule essential that the
property should be in the lawful possession of another person, the in·
tention being to dispossess the latter (possessionis). By Theophilus
furtum possessionis is understood to mean the wrongsul appropriation'of
a thing by a person who already has possession or detention of it (ὅτε τὸ
δοθὲν ἐπὶ τῷ νέμεσθαι ὡς ἐνέχυρον ἦ ὦς dendo-arou νέμομαι ὦς δεσπότης), in
other words, the arbitrary and wrongful conversion os detention or civil
possession into usucapion possession corpore et animo 3 but this is rather
furtum ipsius rei, and Theophilus' view is discountenanced by ἕξ 6—10
inf.: cs. Dig. 47. 2. 74.

Furtum then may occur in any of the following ways :

(1) Theft in the popular sense : ‘ cum quis rem alienam invito domino
contrectat ' ξ 6 3 ‘ fur est, qui dolo malo rem alienam contrectat ’ Paul. sent.
rec. ²··31· 1. ,

(2) Τὴε wrong-ful appropriation of a res aliena which one already
possesses or detains, e. g. as depositam, agent, usufructuary, etc. (cf.
Theophilus supr.) ; of 'this no illustrationis are given in this Title, but see
Dig. 47. 2. 1. 23 ib. 333 ib. 43. 13 16. 3. 293 17. 1. 22. 7.

(3) The wrongful appropriationes property found, Bk. ii. 1. 48 supr„
Dig. 47. 2. 43. 4-11. ’

(4) The mala fide alienation os a res aliena, Bk. ii. 6. 3 supr.

(5) The wilful destruction of bonds in order to destroy evidence of debt‚
Dig. 47. 2. 283 ib. 32 ; ib. 4. 52.

(6) The wrong-ful using of a res aliena of which one has possession or
detention, e. g. by depositarius, pledgee, or commodatarius, ξ 6 inf.

(7) furtum of res sua, ξ 10 and noteS, inf.

For the prohibition of furtum by natural law cf. Cic. de off. 3. 5 ‘ illud
natura non patitur, ut aliorum spoliis nostras facultates augeamu5,’
Augustin. ConsesS. 2. 4. 1 ‘furtum certe punit lex scripta in cordibus
hominum! Among certain peoples (e. g. the Egyptians, Lacedaemoniam,
and Samians) theft is said to have been allowed by their own municipal
law; Diodor. Sic. 1. 80, Xenophon, rep. Laced. 2. 8, Plutarch, Lycurgus
12.
