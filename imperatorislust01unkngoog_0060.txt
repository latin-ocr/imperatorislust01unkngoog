Under Augu-stus we first find traces of a division of the jurists into
two sects or schools. Their respective leaders, distinguished from
one another by a difference of political no less than of legal vieWS,
were Antistius Labeo and C. Ateius Capito, Labeo had inherited from
his father Quintus a strong republican sentiment, and was in the habit
of lamenting the prevailing disrespect of the good old laws which
had never been constitutionally abrogated. At first an auditor of
TrebatiuS‚ he attended the chambers of all the prominent jurists of his
day 3 and the width of his studies liberalised his views on law, and
saved him from a sailing which was not uncommon among his con-
temporaries, a slavish devotion to the tenets of some particular
teacher. A man of varied culture and instructed in sar more than one
department of knowledge, his leading characteristics were a wide
intellectual range, a correct appreciation of the place os law in social
development and of its relation to other scienceS, a dislike of all
pedantry‚ a wealth of new views and principleS, with which he was
ever ready to challenge and supersede the old. Sixty-three excerpts
from his writings are preserved in the Digest. Capito was more or less
of a novus home, and a supportet of the imperial regrz‘me, in which he
saw the best prospects of his own advancer'nent. It is related of him
that, with a salse show os independence, he opposed Tiberius when the
latter wished to stop the prosecution of a man accused of putting an
affront upon the imperial dignity. As a jurist, he was distinguished
by a devotion to the letter of the law and the traditional treatment of
legal questions, and by a too literal interpretation of positive mles,

The opposition betweenssthe two was thus the opposition between
an absolute reliance on traditional principles and opinions supported
by approved authority, and a legal mind conscious of its powers, of
the living organic nature of law, of the inevitableness of its growth
and expansion. It resulted in a number of legal controversies be-
tween Labeo and Capite, which they bequeathed to their successors;
thus originating the two schools whose disputes were ever widening
their range, and which termed their founders and leaders ‘ nostri
praeceptoreS,' and those of their opponents ‘ diversae scholae prae-
ceptore8,' respectively. The leading disciple of Capito was Masurius
Sabinus (Gaius ii. 218), {rom whom the school derived its name
‘ Sabinian,' and wh0, as having given it a new directi0n‚ is to be
regarded as its proper founder. Capito had contented himself with a
passive resistance to Labeo’s innovations; Sabinus and his followers
even went so far as to adopt Labeo’s tendency to develope new views,
but were careful to disagree from. the other school whenever an
