state, in itselt} had nothing to do with private law3 for their very
purpose is to place the two in a relation to one another which
previously did not exist: and that absence os opposition consists, not
in the domination of private law by the state, but of the state by
private law: that is to say, the state is constructed on private law
principles. The evolution of private law out of the state would be a
contradiction of all history ¹.' Nor is the force of this argument in
any way weakened by the admitted fact that the principal dispositione
known to early Roman law were effected under state supervision
(p. 18, supr.). The object of this was to obtain a public guarantee
for the rights which they conferred3 a citizen who disputed such
rights would be resisting the authority of the whole people. And it
is conceivable that the idea of law backed by irresistible force, with
which Austin has made us familiar, and which is peculiar to societies
in which the judicature is and has long been organized on an effective
system, was developed out of this expedientes defending individual
rights, through the medium of a form, by the collective force of the
whole community: ‘ das Concrete war hier wie so ost in der Ges-
chichte des romischen Rechts die Brucke zum Abstracten3 aus dem
Schutz der Rechte entwickelte sich der Schutz des Rechts.⁹

Like so many other irresponsible rulers, the ‘ decemviri legibus
scribundis' were corrupted by the taste of power which they had
enjoyed3 so much did they relish it that they attempted to make their
own office permanent, and to revolutionise the form of government
by substituting themselves entirely for the consuls and tribunes. Pre-
tending to make an ‘ exaequatio iuris ’ the main object of their policy,
they set to work to attain it by reactionary measures; they were for
retaining the comitia curiata only for religious purposes, and for
abolishing the comitia tributa altogether ς thus the plebeians would
lose their organization, and so their very existence as an order, while
the privileges os the patricians would be perpetuated, though under ·
forms slightly altered or disguised. The plebs saw through the
design, and (s. c. 449) resorted once again to the well-tried stratagem
of a secession. The patrician opposition at once crumbled to no-
thing, and the old constitution, with its consuls and tn'bunes, was
restored. By alex of the consuIS, Horatius and Valerius (s.c. 449), it
was enacted ‘ut quod tributim plebs iussisset populum teneret3' words
which must not be understood to mean that the comitia tributa
thereby received a legislative authority co·ordinate and co·extensive
