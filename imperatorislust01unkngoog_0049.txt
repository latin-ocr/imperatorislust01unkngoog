city. Stoicism was first raised to full influence in the higher ranks
os Roman society by means of the group which gathered round
Scipio Aemilianus, who died nc. 129 ; and Quintus Scaevola, consul
n c. 95, and the founder of scientific jurisprudence, was one of its
earliest eminent disciples We may believe that from the last-men-
tioned date onward its doctrines were applied to the development of
law with consistency and success3 but it still remains to be proved
that the Romans did not begin to regasd the ius gentium with feelings
other than of disdain until this period. The edict of the praetor pere·
grinus had been in existence, and applied to citizens in their relations
nith foreignerS, for more than a century and a half, and edicta provin-
cialia had been issued sor considerably more than a century; and we
cannot believe, on the one hand, that the praetor urbanus could have
witnessed the continuous growth of this liberal and reasonable system
of law without having adopted portions of it in his own edict during
the second century 13.c., while, on the other, it is impossible that this
could have been done without the approval os the profession and of
the nation. Stoicism then, it would seem, cannot be credited with
having been the original and entire cause of the change in the feelings
with which the Romans regarded the ius gentium. On the other hand,
it is probably true that, after the time of Scaevola, the improvements in
the law, in respect not only of interna! development, but also os
scientific treatment, were due in a very large degree to the alliance
between the lawyers and the Stoa. The identification of the ius gen-
tium with the law of nature was not universally admitted till the age
of the classical jurists, among whom we find one so eminent even as
Ulpian attempting to distinguish them ¹. But we cannot overestimate

¹ The position osius naturale in the legal system, as compared with ius gentium,
is not precisely determined in the passages of the Corpus Iuris which relate to it.
Sometimes and indeed most frequently, they are used as synonymous (e. g Inst. ii.
1. 11, where they are identified) ; and where this is so, the expression ius naturale
refers to its assumed origin, and to the accord of certain legal principles with the
needs and requirements os the reasonable nature of man. It is this ‘naturalis
ratio’ which furnishes the raw material os the ius naturale, and from which the
latter derives its universal validity3 as reason is man’s ⁸ differentia,’ ius naturale must
be valid wherever man is to be found, and therefore is coextensive with ius gentium.
Sometimes. however, a narrower signification is given to ius naturale, and it is
used to indicate the aggregate os those institutions os Roman law which were
deemed to be based not so much on the intellectual as on the moral side of human
nature, or to a certain extent on an instinct shared with man by the lower animals.
This is the sense which the expression bears in Inst. i. 2. pr. (on which see note),
where it is distinguished from ius gentium, and in Ulpian in Dig. 1. 1. 1. 4 ‘ius
gentium est quo gentes humanae utuntur. Quod a naturali recedere, facile in·
