Poste on Gaius iii. 103 and 162, maintains that, with the exception os
stipulation, the only formal contract surviving in Justinian's time, B
could make any contract for A in the latter’s name, so as to confer
rights on him alone and enable him alone to sue. This is based on
Dig. 41. 1. 53 ‘ ea quae civiliter adquiruntur per eos qui in potestate
nostra sunt adquirimus, veluti per stipulationem: quod naturaliter
adquiritur, sicuti est possessi0, per quemlibet volentibus nobis possi-
dere adquirimus.' But in this passage, as has been remarked by
many writers, it is probable that its author, ModestinuS, wrote manci-
pationem, not stipulationem, which the compilers of the Digest sub-
stituted for it as being the only old formal disposition surviving in
their day ; and it is clear, from its position in the Title ‘ De adquirendo
rerum domini0,' that it does not relate to contracts at all, but only to
the question whether anything more than possession in a res corporalis
could be acquired per extraneam personam: see note on Bk. ii. 9. 5
supr. But after all, perhaps the best criticism of this theory of Savigny's
is that of Mr. Hunter, that if the Roman law had really attained to a
true conception of agency, the fact must have been patent in many
texts; whereas in point of fact its author is unable to support it by
any really pertinent textual authority, except the very doubtful passage
last cited.

Consequently, the agent must make the contract in his own name z
and the desired effect—the conferring of rightS, and the imposition of
dtutieS, upon his principal—was first attained only after the introduc·-
tion of the formulary procedure (Gaius iv. 86, 87) and in a very cum-
brous and circuitous manner. If (e. g.) A, being at Rome, wished to
buy a house belonging to C at NapleS, he would give Β (at Naples) a
mandate to buy it for him. B does 80, and then assigns his rights
against C to A, i. e. makes him his procurator in rem suam (cf. p. 465
supr.) ; C’s rights against B, e. g. his claim for the purchase money,
can be made available against A only by a novatio: if this is not done,
C, is necessary, must recover from B by actio venditi, and Β from A by
actio mandati contraria. Here none of the conditione above specified
are realized. A, so far from alone acquiring rights against C under
the contraet, acquires them only indirectly as his own agent’s assiguee3
C acquires rights against A, if at all, not by the eontract of sale, but

-by the novation to which A is himself a party3 and B is in fact the
principal and true vendee throughout, and the only person who is en-
titled and bound in that capacity. In short, the desired effect is not
attained simply by A's making Β his agent, but by a double mandatum
and a novatio: A makes B his agent sor the proposed purchase from.
