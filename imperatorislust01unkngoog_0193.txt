INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II. 181

other parts of the system, they must, in reason, be eo·ordinated with
other facts from which the same kind of legal relation, namely
obligation, arises. And from this point of view Mr. Hunter is him-
self inconsistent, sor he co-ordinates with contracts certain other
sources of obligation, viz. quasi-contract, and what he calls Status,
while he omits delict from this connection altogether. Under Status,
as a source os obligation, he groups the family relations os husband
and wife, and parent and child; but the incorrectness of this had
been long before shown by Savigny (System ξ 58), who remarks that
these relationS, and that produced by contract or delict, are altogether
disparate3 the latter being the partial and temporary subjection of one
person to the will of another, the former being permanent, and having
a content natural and moral as well as legal: its legal content being
not so much the personal right against the other party as a real right
to non-disturbance by the world at large ¹.

Important changes had taken place in the law comprised in this
second Book since the time of Gaius. In respect of modes of
acquisition the ius gentium had reaped another triumph3 in iure
cessio and mancipatiO, the oldest titles of the ius civile, which had
already become practically obsolete, were sormally abolished by
justinian, who also swept away, in the train of the latter, a trouble-
some distinction and much antiquated learning. The simplification
os law effected by the recognition of traditio or mere delivery as the
universal mode of conveying res singulae is however perhaps no
more to be admired than Justinian's masterly codification, or more
properly reform, of the law of Usucapio or Prescription‚ which had
hitherto consisted of two different sets of rules, the one civil, the other
praetorian, whose divergence had been occasioned by the absurd
survival of the doctrine that provincial soil could not be owned by
private individuals. The great change in the proprietasy rights of
filiifamilias, initiated under Constantine by the institution of quasi—
castrense and adventitium peculium, was consummated by Justinian
himself 3 the survival of the patria potestas was thus made tolerable
by the partial surrender of one of its most valuable privileges· The
direct acquisition of possession, and so of ownership through agents,
had been sanctioned by a constitution of SeveruS, based upon a con-
sensus among the jurists, who in Gaius' time had been divided upon
the question3 and the interests of mortgagors were carefully guarded
by Justinian's regulations as to the exercise of powers of sale and
foreclosure. In the law of wius, apart from changes in their form,
