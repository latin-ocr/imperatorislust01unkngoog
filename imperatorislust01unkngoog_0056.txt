legislation: ‘ et hoc non primum a nobis dictum est, sed ab antiqua
descendit prosapia, quum et ipse IulianuS, legum et edicti perpetui
subtilissimus conditor, in suis libris hoc retulit, ut, si quid imper-
fectum inveniatur, ab imperiali sanctione hoc repleatur ; et non ipse

sulto, quod eam secutum est, hoc apertissime definivit, ut si quid

Const. ‘ tanta' de Confirm. Digest. § 18).

The mention οῖ the responsa prudentium among the sources os the
ius civile makes it necessary to spealt of the work done by the jurist
class in the development of Roman law; and as it was to the
jurists that that law owed what scientific form it possessed, besides
many of its other special merita, it will not be amiss to discuss this
subJ'ect with some fullness. The names of the early prudentes who
lived under the free Republic are collected by Pomponius in Dig. 1.
2. 2. 35-393 the first is that of Papirius, whose compilation of the leges
regiae has been already noticed. These earliest lawyers are styled
prudentes not because their knowledge of the law was more scientific,
less empirical, than that of other men, but rather because they knew it
more fully; a philosophical treatment of law had not yet commenced,

, and such distinction as there was between their legal knowledge and

that os the ordinary citizen was quantitative rather than qualitative.
The first condition of their existence as a professional class was the ces-
sation of the pontifices to be ‘iuris conditores,' and the liberation of pri-
vate law from the setters of the ius sacrum3 it has been suggested that
this was effected in the main by the incorporation os the plebeian clement
in the state. The direction of their legal activity is denoted by Cicero
(de Orat. i. 48) by the four terms respondere, cavere, agere, and scribere.
Respondere expressed the delivery of opinions (⁴ iuris civilis scientiam
publice profiteri ') when consulted by either judges or private persons;
cavere, the advising more definitely on legal matters, such as the proper
mode of concluding some transaction, or of enforcing a right in the
courts 3 agere, the actual participation in the process as patronus, or
by presently superintending a legal disposition; scribere, the drasting
os technical documents in proper legal phrase, the more mechanical
part of the labour being perhaps undertaken by clerks or secretaries.
But the most prominent of their functions, the capacity in which the
ordinary citizen had most frequent occasion to consult them, was as
advisers on the practice os the law. The ordinary citizen could not
be acquainted with the complicated forms of procedure, or master the
