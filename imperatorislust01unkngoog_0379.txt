as heir (ξ 2 supr. ε cf. note on Bk. ii. 10. 2 supr.) 3 i. e. he allowed him to
sue and be sued by the action3‚ as utileS, which lay at the suit of and
against the heres, as directae : Ulpian‚ reg. 28. 12. t cf. Gaius iv. 34 ‘. . . .
is qui ex edicto bonorum possessionem petiit, ficto se herede agit.’ After
the establishment of the Empire, and before Hadrian, he waS, like the
heres, enabled to sue sor the universitas by a ‘possessoria hereditatis
petitio ’ Dig. 5. 5. For another view of the relation between the interdict
and hereditatis petitio see on Bk. iv. 15. 3 inf.

A noticeable point of difference between bonorum possessio and here-
ditas is that the former was never acquired ipso iure, as the latter was
by necessarii or sui et necessarii heredes, It was obtained originally by
application to the praetor (agnitio or petitio bonorum possessionis),
which could be made by an agent, while no one could accept an inherit-
ance except the person to whom it was delata, note on Bk. ii. 19. 7 supr.
This application was usually granted without precise inquiry into the
applicant's title, which, if investigated at all, was investigated later, and
only because it was disputed by some one who alleged that his own right
was a better one. In this case the latter would be granted a second and
formal bonorum possessio ‘litis ordinandae gratia! The sons of Con-
stantine enacted that bonorum possessio might be obtained from any
judge or magistrate by a mere signification of acceptance, Cod. 6. 9. 8
and 9, though this was still called agnitio or petitio ; and this is the rule
referred to by Justinian in ξ 12 inf. as holding in his day.

The right to take the possession could be lost by either express re-
pudiation (§ mins.) or lapse os the time (specified in § 9 ; Ulpian‚ reg. 28.
ιο) within which it was required by law to be exercised. A person barred
by such lapse was excluded only from one rank or class: if he was
admitted by the edict in a lower rank also, he had another opportunity
(‘ sibi ipse succedere ³ Dig. 38. 9. 1. 10 and 1 1). Occasionally, however, the
praetor would not grant bonorum possessio without an examination into
the circumstances of the particular case. For instance, the edictum
Carbonianum provided, that if the parentage of an impubes, upon which
his rights of succession depended‚ was disputed, the magistrate should
hold a summary inquiry, and if in this his alleged parentage was not
clearly disproved, bonorum possessio should be granted provisionally to
him upon security being given against waste, until the question at issue
was definitely settled, such settlement often being postponed until the
child attained puberty. In cases of this sort, if bonorum possessio was
eventually granted aster the magisterial examination, it was called
bonorum possessio decretalis in contrast with that which was given

’ under the general provisions of the edict (edictalis).

Even supposing the bonorum possessor had an indefeasible title as
such, the praetor did not necessarily guarantee him the succession
against a possible heres, who might have remained satisfied with his
civil law title. E.g. a suus is praeteritus in the father’s will, by which the
