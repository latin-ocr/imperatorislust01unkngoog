256 INSTIT UTI ΟΝ UM LIBRI QUA T T UOR. [Lib. 11.

3 qui in uteroest, servus recte heres instituitur. Servus plurium,
,cum quibus testamenti factio est', ab extraneo institutus heres
unicuique dominorum, cuius iussu adierit, pro portione dominii

adquirit hereditatem.
4 Et unum hominem et plures in infinitum, quot quis velit,
5 heredes facere licet. Hereditas plerumque dividitur in duode-

tion of the difficulty os transferring an inheritance inter vivos. The
maxim being semel heres, semper heres, it was idle to talk of trans-
ferring the universitas iuris when a man had once actually become heir
by aditio. But at an earlier moment it might have been possible 3 what
was there to prevent one to whom a hereditas was delata, and who
thus had the right of accepting, from transferring that right of ac-
ceptance to another? The aditio of an inheritance, however, was an
actus legitimuS, performable only by the actual person to whom it was
delata, so that even where the person was a slave, who got nothing by
aditio, he must accept himself 3 his master could not do it for him, and
consequently the Romans refused consistently to admit any such assign-
ment. To this general rule there are but very few exceptions, usually
called ‘ cases of transmission,’ only one of which concerns us here.
Gaius tells us (ii. 35) that when an inheritance was delata to an agnate
under an intestacy, he could, in lieu of personally exercising his right of
aditio, transfer it by in iure cessio to anyone he pleased, and then
‘perinde fit heres is cui in iure cesserit, ac si ipse per legem ad heredi·
tatem vocatus esset! But this was the only case in which such transfer
was possible: and considering the Roman dislike of intestacy, and the
subordinate position of agnates to sui, it must even in Gaius’ time have
been a very rare one.

If, however, 'A instituted C, the slave of B, on A’s decease B could
either actually become heir by directing C to make aditio, or he could
get all the advantage derivable from the successim, without incurring
the trouble of administration, by selling C at a price enhanced by his
character of institutus: C then made aditio at the direction of the
purchaser, who thereby became heres· If the first owner was reluctant
to permanently part with his slave, he had only to bargain for his recon-
veyance by a covenant annexed to the sale, Dig. 28. 3. 58.

Another clumsy expedient for effecting the same purpose was a sale
of the inheritance by the heres after acceptance. This was no violation

of the rule semel heres, semper heres, because it did not produce a
universal succession: the purchaser became owner os the deceased's

tangible property only by traditio (cod. 4. 39. 6), succeeded to his rights
in personam only as cessionary (Dig. 18. 4. 2. 3 and 8), and became
answerable for his debts only according to the ordinary rules of inter-
cession. When, however, the inheritance was purchased from the fiscus,
the vendee was a genuine universal successor, Cod. 4. 39. 1. For prac-

tical illustrations of such sales see Tit. 23 inf.
