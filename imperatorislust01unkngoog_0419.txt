ratori suo dari stipulatus sit, stipulatio vires habebit. et
si creditori suo quod sua interest, ne sorte vel poena com-
mittatur vel praedia distrahantur quae pignori data erant,
valet stipulatio, Versa vice qui alium facturum promisit, 21
videtur in ea esse causa, ut non teneatur, nisi poenam ipse
promiserit. Item nemo rem suam suturam in eum casum quo 22
sua fit utiliter stipulatur. Si de alia re stipulator senserit, de 23
alia promissor, perinde nulla contrahitur obligatio, ac si ad
interrogatum responsum non esset, veluti si hominem Stichum
a te stipulatus quis fuerit, tu de Pamphilo senseriS, quem

§ 21. See on § 3 supr.

§22 For a man to stipulate for conveyance to him, when he has
become its owner, of property which will be his hereafter, is the same
thing in effect as to stipulate for a res which is already sua, for which see
on 2 supr.

§ 23. The two chief varieties of mistake have been distinguished on
Bk. ii. 20. 29 supr. To say of contracts that they are void by reason of
mistake in the expression of intention is incorrect: they are void, if at
all, because one states that one intends what one does not really intend,
though it is true that, had it not been sor a mistake, this statement would
never have been made. It is not, however, enough to nullify a disposition
that a mistake has caused a declaration which was not really intended :
the expressed intention must have been unintended either altogether, or
at least in an essential portion : and this is the true meaning of the dic·
tum that ‘essential error alone is a ground of nullity.’ By essentia] error,
in this sense, is to be understood error as to either (a) the nature of the
legal relation or right to be produced : ‘ non satis autem est dantis esse
nummos et fieri accipientis, ut obligatio nascatur, sed etiam hoc animo
dari et accipi, ut obligatio constituatur; itaque si quis pecuniam suam
donandi causa dederit mihi, quamquam et donantis suerit et mea fiat,
tamen non obligabor ei, quia non hoc inter nos actum est' Dig. 44. 7. 3.
1 ε or (b) the person in relation to whom the intention is declared, pro-
vided this is material, Dig. 28. 5. 9. pr.: or (c) the thing in relation to
which the intention is declared (e. g. the text before us, and Dig. 28. 5. 9.
1 ; 30. 4. pr.; 45. 1. 137. 1 : or (d) the propertieS, i. e. quality, of that
thing ; as to which the rule extracted by Savigny in respect of sale from
the cases is that ‘the error avoids the contract when the difference in
quality between the thing bought, and that which the purchaser intended
to buy, is such, according to commercial usage, as to put the one in a
different category of merchandise for the other,' System §§ 137, 138: sor
