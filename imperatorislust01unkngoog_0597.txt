toriae sunt exceptiones: quales sunt procuratoriae, veluti si
per militem aut mulierem agere quis velit: nam militibus nec
pro patre vel matre vel uxore nec ex sacro rescripto procu-
ratorio nomine experiri conceditur: suis vero negotiis super-
esse sine offensa disciplinae possunt. eas vero exceptiones,
quae olim procuratoribus propter infamiam vel dantis vel
ipsius procuratoris opponebantur, cum in iudiciis frequentari ·

acquitted; the judge's sententia (which modern writers call absolutio ·
ab instantia as contrasted with absolutio ab actione) was that at that
time he did not owe the plaintiff what had been demanded from him,
and the latter could renew his action when the obstacle was removed,
though he had to wait twice as long as would otherwise have been
necessary, pay all the plaintifl's costs hitherto incurred, and in the
meanwhile could claim no interest on the debt. As appears from the
text (ante tempus pactionis vel obligationis) the procedure was the same
whether the obligation was originally ex die, or payment was postponed
subsequently by a ‘ pactum de non petendo intra certum tempus.’ Among
dilatory pleas ‘quae ad tempus nocent ’ were in Gaius’ time (iv. 122) the
exceptiones litis dividuae and litis residuae.

ξ 11. Gaius-exemplifies exceptiones ex persona dilatoriae (iv. ¹24) by
the plea that the plaintiff was suing by a cognitor when the edict dis·
qualified him from being so represented, or had appointed as his cognitor
a person similarly disabled from acting in that capacity; he does not
mention the exceptio procuratoria, though infames were disabled from
both representing others and being themselves represented in that form,
fragm. Vat. 322-3. For infamia generally see on Tit. 16. 2 inf. Jus-
tinian’s enactment in the last lines of the paragraph seems merely to
have formally deprived defendants of a right which they had practically
ceased to exercise‚ and not to have affected the disability of infames to
appoint or appear as procurators; the judge could still reject an agent
because either he could not act as such, or the true party could not be so
represented, but the defendant could not.

Women could not be procurators on the principle of the SC. Vel-
leianum‚ that all interventio was a virile munus. By eod. 2. 13. 2 5 state
officials of higher rank were ordered to conduct their suits by agents, lest
by appearing personally they should disturb the impartiality of the court.

As a general rule exceptions are not subject to prescription‚ for a
defendant cannot advance them when he will, but must wait till he is
sued: ‘cum actor quidem in sua potestate habeat, quando utatur suo
iure, is autem, cum quo agitur, non habet potestatem quando con-
veniatur ’ Dig. 44. 4. 5. 6. When, however, a party can assert his right by
