XXVIII.

PER QUAS PERSONAS NOBIS OBLIGATIO ADQUIRITUR.

Expositis generibus obligationum, quae ex contractu vel
quasi ex contractu nascuntur, admonendi sumus adquiri vobis
non solum per vosmet ips03, sed etiam per eas quoque per-
sonas quae in vestra potestate sunt, veluti per servos vestros
et filios: ut tamen, quod per servos quidem vobis adquiritur,
totum vestrum fiat, quod autem per liberm, quos in potestate
habetiS, ex obligatione fuerit adquisitum, hoc dividatur se-
cundum imaginem rerum proprietatis et usus fructuS, quam

. nostra discrevit constitutio: ut, quod ab actione commodum
perveniat, huius usum fructum quidem habeat pater, proprietas
autem filio servetur, scilicet patre actionem movente secundum

1 novellae nostrae constitutionis divisionem. Item per liberos
homines et alienos εει-νος, quos bona fide possidetis, adqui·
ritur vobiS, sed tantum ex duabus causis, id est si quid ex

2 operis suis vel ex re vestra adquirant. Per eum quoque

has been pointed out on p. 382 supr. If the condictio 'had been allowed,
the penalty of duplum need never be incurred 3 the defendant would pay
the simplum, and then practically deny his liability by disputing the cor-
rectness of the payment in condictio indebiti, failure in which would
leave him no worse off than he was before.

vit. XXVIII. Obligatio in this Title means a right arising ex con-
tractu : it tells us who takes the benefit of a conti-act made by a filius-
familias, slave, or free man bona fide serviens: cf. Tit. 17 supr. The
converse question, how sar the superior is bound by their promiseS, is
treated in Bk. iv. 7 inf.

For the ‘ divisio rerum proprietatis et ususfructus ³ see on Bk ii. 9. pr.
supr. The commodum arising from the contracts of a filiusfamilias was
not necessarily divided in this manner. If he had only castrense or
quasi-castrense peculium, the commodum was all his own, and on such
contracts he could sue in person, Dig. 14. 6. 2 ε 49. 17. 41, ib. 5 τ Cod. 6.
8. pr.-2. If his peculium was profectitium only, it was all the father’s3
if he had adventitium as well, the father had a usufruct in the commodum
obligationis in the ratio which it bore to the other peculia ‘ quae adqui-
sitionem effugiunt’ Cod. 6. 61. 6. The pater alone could sue on these

latter contractS‚ Cod. ib. 8. pr.—2 3 for other exceptional cases in·which the
latter had a right of action see p. 118 supr.

§ 2. The slave in whom one has a usus is not mentioned above in Bk.
