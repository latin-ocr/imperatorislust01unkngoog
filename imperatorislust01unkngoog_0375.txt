DE ADSIGNATIONE LIBERTORUM.

In summa quod ad bona libertorum admonendi sumus
senatum censuisse, ut quamvis ad omnes patroni liber03, qui
eiusdem gradus sint, aequaliter bona libertorum pertineant,
tamen liceret parenti uni ex liberis adsignare libertum, ut post
mortem eius solus is patronus habeatur, cui adsignatus est, et
ceteri liberi, qui ipsi quoque ad eadem bona nulla adsignatione
interveniente pariter admitterentur, nihil iuris in his bonis
habeant. sed ita demum pristinum ius recipiunt, si is cui
adsignatus est decesserit nullis liberis relictis, Nec tantum 1
libertum, sed etiam libertam, et non tantum filio nepotive,
sed etiam filiae neptive adsignare permittitur. Datur autem 2
haec adsignandi facultas ei, qui duos pluresve liberos in
potestate habebit, ut eis», quos in potestate habet, adsignare
ei libertum libertamve liceat. unde quaerebatur, si eum cui

to a libertus civis invariably descended to the patrons' children ; that of
taking the property of a Latinus belonged to his heres (Gaius iii. 58) ε a
libertus civis was succeeded by j0int patrons in equal shares‚ though
before his manumission they might have owned him in unequal propor-
tions τ ‘ bona vero Latinorum pro ea parte pertinent pro qua parte quis-
que eorum dominus fuit’ (Gaius ib. 59). One patron of a civis excluded
another patron’s son, and so on, but the property of a Latinus went to
one patron and another patron’s heir in the ratio in which it would have
belonged to the two patrous (ib. 60) ; between joint patrons of a civis
there was accrual, ‘ bona autem Latini pro parte decedentis patroni
caduca fiunt et ad populum pertinent ’ (ib. 62). The SC. Largianum, Λα).
42, enacted that where the patron of a Latinus instituted an extraneus
heres, the right of taking his property upon his decease should belong to
the patron’s children so sar as they were not expressly disinherited,
Gaius ib. 67—7 1. For the attainment of civitas by a Latinus ex beneficio
principis, to which the edict of Trajan related, cf. Gaius iii. 72, Ulpian‚
reg. 3. 2, and Mr. Poste’s notes on Gaius i. 28-3 5.

The fate os the property of a deceased dediticius libertus h‘ad depended
upon the mode of his manumission. If it had been such as would have
made him a civis, were it not for the ‘vitium’ owing to which he
necessarily became dediticius (p. 109, supra), the property devolved as
though he actually were a civis libertus ε if, except for the disqualification,
it would have made him a Latinus», it devolved as though he actually
were a Latium, Gaius iii. 74—76.
