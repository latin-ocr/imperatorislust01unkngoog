singuliS‚ qui modo solvendo sint litis contestatae tempore,
partes petere. ideoque si quis ex fideiussoribus eo tempore
solvendo non sit, hoc ceteros onerat. sed et si ab uno
fideiussore creditor totum consecutus fuerit, huius solius de-

he would be bound for the sponsio of a slave or peregrinus, which would
be void also, Gaius iii. 1 19.

θ 3. By saying that a fideiussor ‘praecedere obligationem potest’ is
meant only that a man may on the occurrence of some event in the
future become fideiussor nolens volens, not that he is obligatus before
the principal debtor is. If the contraot were in the form ‘id quod mihi A
debebit, fide tua esse iubes?' the promisor was not bound at once; but
if A subsequently became the promisee's debtor, then the fideiussor was
bound3 the promise was in effect made subject to a suspensive con-
dition : for the legal position in such cases see on Tit. 15. 4 supr. 3
cs. ξ 5 inf.

§ 4. Two or more fideiussors never enjoyed the benefits of the leges
Apuleia and Furia ; any one of them was liable to be sued for the whole
debt‚ and is so sued must pay the whole of it. Under the so·called
beneficium divisioniS‚ which was introduced by the epistola Hadriani,
he was enabled, when sued, to demand that if the other fideiussors were
solvent the creditor should divide his claim between him and them, this
demand taking the form osan exceptio to the plaintiff’s contentiori: ‘si
contendat fideiussor caeteros solvendo esse, etiam exceptionem ei dan·
dam,“ si non et illi solvendo sint'' ’Dig. 46. 1. 28· , so that on the general
rule, the burden of proving their solvency lay on the defendant : cf. Cod.
4. 19. 3. Thus he was not in so favourable a position as the sponsor and
fidepromissor under the two statutes referred to; for the liability was
not divided between him and the other fideiussors ipso iure, so that he
would still bave to pay the whole debt if (under the formulary procedure)
he neglected to get the exceptio inserted in the formula of the action, or
if all the others were insolvent ; in other words, his liability was affected
by the insolvency os the rest, that of a sponsor or fidepromissor (at any
rate in Italy) was not.

If one fideiussor paid the whole debt‚ he still had a remedy against the
