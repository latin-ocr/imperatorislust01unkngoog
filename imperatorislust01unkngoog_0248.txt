that intestate was older than testamentary succession see Maine,
Ancient Law pp. 199, 200. Both of them were entirely oral. The will
made per aes et libram was perhaps due in origin to the plebeians, who
had no locus standi in the comitia calata, though it must have been
largely used by the patricianS, owing to the length of the intervals at
which wills could be made in the comitia, ‘ quae bis in anno testamentis
faciendis destinata erant’ Gaius ii. 101. When writing came into general
use, so that the proceedings need no longer be entirely oral‚ it underwent
important changes, which are noticed by Gaius, ii. 103—108, and alluded
to here by Justinian (partim in usu esse desiit), in particular acquiring
the property of secrecy. The will in procinctu, common a few years
before the conquest of Numantia, Velleius Patere. 2. 5, was obsolete in
the time of Cicero, de nat. deor. 2. 3.

§a This praetor-ian will, as it is usually called, was really no will at all :
for a will is a disposition of the civil law, bestowing the hereditas, and
the person taking under it is hereS. It grew out of the irksomeness of the
formalities required in the will per aes et libram, and of the grave injustice
which must frequently have resulted from the avoidance of wills through
trivia] defects of form, which eventually induced the praetors to uphold
incomplete mancipatory testaments. Regarding form as of value only so
sar as it secured evidence, all that they required was that the written
tabulae of the will should be attested by the seals of seven competent
witnesses: (Justinian's remark that sealing had not been necessary by
the civil law seems contradicted by Cicero (in Verr. 2. 1. 45), who says
that the edict required ‘tabulas testamenti obsignatas non minus multis
signis quam e lege oportet ²). How far, and in what sense, such dis-
positions were upheld is deserving of careful notice, for nothing affords
a more instructive or characteristic illustration of the mode in which the
praetorian law modified and supplemented the old ius civile. By the
latter, such an instrument as a mere written document, no matter by how
many witnesses attested, had absolutely no validity whatever for the
purpose intended. Nor had the praetor authority to enact that it should
avail to pass the hereditas, or that the person named in it as heir should
be heir: ‘ quos autem praetor vocat ad hereditatem, hi heredes ipso quidem
iure non fiunt : nam praetor heredes facere non potest ’ Gaius iii. 32,
