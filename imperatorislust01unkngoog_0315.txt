Tit. ²3·] DE FIDEICOMMJSSARJJS HEREDI TA T IB US . 303

sive noluerit retinere, ipse universa onera hereditaria sus-
tinebat. sed quarta quidem retenta quasi partis et pro
parte stipulationes interponebantur tamquam inter partiar-ium
legatarium et heredem· si vero totam hereditatem restituerit,
emptae et venditae hereditatis stipulationes interponebantur.
sed si recuset scriptus heres adire hereditatem ob id, quod
dicat eam sibi suspectam esse quasi damnosam, cavetur Pega-
siano senatus consulto, ut desiderante e0, cui restituere rogatus
est, iussu praetoris adeat et restituat hereditatem perindeque
ei et in eum qui recipit hereditatem actiones dentur, acsi iuris
est ex Trebelliano senatus consulto: quo casu'nullis stipula-
tionibus opus· est, quia simul et huic quirestituit securitas
datur et actiones hereditariae ei et in eum transferuntur qui
recipit hereditatem, utroque senatus consulto in hac specie

emptae et venditae hereditatis which had previously been necessary. For
actiones utiles see the pages referred to s. v. ‘ actiones directae et utiles '
in the General Index. The operation of the senatusconsult was much
narrowed eleven years later by the enactment of the SC. Pegasianum‚
which (inter alia) provided (1) that fideicommissa should in future be
subject to the rule which had been established for legacies by the lex
Falcidia, and the heir be· entitled to retain for himself a fourth'of the
inheritance clear of fideicommissa. (2) That where fideicommissawere
charged upon an inheritance in excess of three· fourths of its value, the
SC. Trebellianum should have no application. The general result after
this was as follows.

(1) If the fideicommissa did not exceed three -fourths of the whole suc·
cessim, the transfer of those of them which were ‘ hereditates’ was
governed hythe SC. Trebellianum: the transferee became quasi-heir (as
described in ξ 4) and could sue and be sued by utilis actio in respect of the
share he took: no stipulations between him and the heres directus were
required.

(2) If the fideicommissa, whether singular or universal, exceeded three-
fourths of the hereditaS, the only person who could sue and be sued
was the heres directuS, the SC. Trebellianum being excluded. Accord-
ingly, it was necessary to go back to the old contract of indemnification:
else the heir would in all probability find the hereditas damnosa. The·
exact matter of the contract, however, as is remarked in §6, differed
according as the heir availed himself of the SC. Pegasianum, and re·
tained his fourth, or was unable or declined to take advantage of it.

In the former case, the procedure was based upon an older institution,
the legatum partitioniS, by which the heres was instructed in a will to
hand over to a legatee some definite fraction of the inheritance, e.g.
‘heres meus cum Titio hereditatem partim, dividitossUlpian, reg. 24. 25.
