(praedes sacramenti) from both parties sor payment in the event of
defeat. The wager having thus been duly laid, the praetor pro-
ceeded ‘ vindicias dicere‚' to award interim possession to one or other
of the litigante», taking sureties (praedes litis et vindiciarum) for the re·
storation of the property in dispute, and its mesne profits, if the other
proved his title. A iudex was then appointed by agreement to try
the question at issue, namely‚ which was the winner of the wager:
behind which the real matter in litigation—-the ownership of the slave
—lay in the background. Before this judge the case was first leid
in a succinet narrative {orm (causae collectio), which was followed by
evidence and arguments in detail ¹.

Both the remaining legis actiones are in personam. Of iudicis
arbitrive postulatio we have no recorda, save the formula, presens-<1
by Valerius Probus, in which the judge or referee was applied for.
But it seems to have been a sort of modification οἱ the sacramentum,
designed for the settlement of unliquidated claims. The employment
of sacramentum imelf was conditional upon the applicability of the
wager, and this clearly depended on precise knowledge of the pecu-
niary value of that which was claimed by the plaintiff. In other
worda, sacramentum, as an action in personam, lay only on literal
contracta, on such stipulations as were for a certum, and on delicts in
which the pecuniary penalty was fixed by law; and iudicis arbitrive
postulatio seems to have been the remedy on contincts iuris gentium
and on certain quasi conti-actual relations, in which the plaintiff
demands, not something ascertained, but that it shall be ascertained
to what he is in equity entitled from his adversar-y ⁸. Of condictio we
have fuller knowledge. It is said by Gaius (iv. 19) to have been
established by the lex Silia, circ. ²44 nc„ for the recovery of liqui-

The procedure in sacramentnm aster the praedes litis et vindiciarum had been
taken is very obscure, owing to a lacuna* m the MS. os Gaius, iv. 15. According
to Studemund’s τοκεῦ-,1 conjecture, a single judge was originally appointed on me
spot to try the matterz but this was altered by a lex Pinaria, which pmcribed an
interval of thirty days between the legis actio before the praetor and the appoint-
ment os the iudex. Keller supposes that the effect of this statute was not to create
a necessary interval of thirty or any other number of days at all, but to transfer the
hearing os sacramenta from the standing collegia of judges (decemviri and centum·
viri) to a single iudex. Mr. Poste seems to combine these two views, limiting, how-
ever, the operation of the lex Pinaria to such sacramenta as were in personam.

⁸ This is the point os contact between this legis actio and the later bonae fidei
indicia. The equiuble balancing of conflicting clahns seems to be chamuto-istic
of both.
