Few subjects have been so much disputed, and we may perhaps
say misunderstood‚ by modern jurists, as the nature of customary law,
its validity‚ and the relation (if the two ‚terms are to be distinguished)
between customary law and custom. That custom ever has any force as
positive law is vehemently denied by Austin ; until it receives the impress
of the judge or legislator, it is only positive morality (Jurisprudence p. 37) 3
when it has received that impress it ceases to be custom and becomes
positive law, though the name ‘customary law' for it is convenient as
perhaps suggesting the ground on which it has been invested with a legal
sanction (ib. p. 204). The error os this view (which Austin himself admits
runs counter to all the utterances of the Roman jux-ists) has been shown

by Sir Η. Maine (Early History of Institutions‚ lectures 12 and 13) to have ⁶

originated in Austin’s habit os basing his generalisations on observatione
only of Western communities, in which the engrossing power of direct
legislation had been kept in men’s memories by traditions of the Roman
Empire. As to the way in which enatem, as law (i.e. before it is em·
bodied in legislation direct or indirect)‚ is generated‚ and how it acquires
its binding force, there have also been great differences of opinion. The
question is really as to the relation between the usage‚.and the conscious-
ness that that usage is a right one, and one which (legally) ought to be
followed, or as to the relation between the usage and the binding rule, or,
as it is sometimes shortly though unhappily expressed‚ between custom
and law. The earlier view was that customary law is law generated by
custom, diuturnus usus. In this or that relation of life, people follow
a unisorm practice, and this practice, in virtue of its uniformity, is called
a custom; before long it gains so strong a hold upon the mind as to be
followed as law, and in fact to become law, which the Courts (the protec-
tion of security, and attainment of fixity os relations, being part of their
business) will enforce. Custom is thus said to be a source of law,
and law proper, in the history of nearly every natiom to be preceded by
custom.

Savigny was the author (Syst. i. p. 34 sq.) of the view, now generally
accepted by German jurists, that custom is not one of the sources of law,
but only its token or external manifestation ; the law itself is grounded
on the common legal consciousness of the nation. If the people, as
a people, is conscious of a rule, or thinks that such or such a principle
ought to be followed as law, this principle so asserts itself as to be applied
and developed ; the usage is thus evoked and occasioned by the principle
which the popular mind approves and acceptS, instead of being itself the
source of that principle. The consciousness of the rule must precede the
usage or custom, for it is upon this that the uniformity of action is based:
