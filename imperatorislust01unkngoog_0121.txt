Tit. 5.] DE LJBERTJNJS. 109

antiqui iuris altercationes placavimus: Latinos autem Iunianos
et omnem quae circa eos fuerit observantiam alia constitutione
per eiusdem quaestoris suggestionem correximuS‚ quae inter
imperiales radiat sanctioneS, et omnes libertos nullo nec aetatis
manumissi nec dominii manumissoris nec in manumissionis
modo discrimine habito, sicuti antea observabatur, civitate
Romana donavimus: multis additis modiS, per quos possit
libertas servis cum civitate Romana, quae sola in praesenti
est, praestari.

solenniter’ the rights of Latinitas (General Introd. p. 26 supr.), whence
they were called Latini Iuniani. The Latinitas of the Latini coloniarii
had conferred the commercium without the connubium, i.e. the power
os holding property and engaging in commerce under the peculiar forms
and protection of Roman law, and os making a testament valid iure
civili. But these rights were seriously curtailed, in the case os Latini
Iuniani, by the lex Iunia Norbana, which (Gaius i. 22-24 Ulpian, reg.
20. 8) deprived them of the privileges of making a will, being named
testamentary guardians, and benefiting under the will of another person.
Consequently, when a Latinus Iunianus died, as he could have no suus
heres or agnate‚ his whole property went ‘ iure quodammodo peculii’ to
his patron3 Bk. iii. 7. 4 inf. Justinian repealed the lex Iunia, and as to
the modes of manumission to which it had related, he enacted that they
should make a slave a full citizen provided they were evidenced by five
witnesses ; Cod. 7. 6. The alii multi modi alluded to in ξ 1 are specified
in the same constitution ε among them are the formal designation of the
slave by the master as his son, and the delivery to him of the docu-
ments by which his servitude could be proved. There were numerous
modes in which a Latinus could attain the civitas 3 see Gaius i. 28-3 5, and
Mr. Poste's notes.

The object of the lex Aelia Sentia (ΑΛ). 4) was to throw obstacles in
the way of inconsiderate manumission5‚ and to guard the state against
the dangers which might result from the bestowal of citizenship on
slaves of bad character and antecedents; it should thus be read in
close connection with the lex Fufia Caninia, Tit. 7 inf. Four of its pro-
visions concern us. (1) It enacted that slaves who had been guilty of
some serious crime, or subjected to some degrading treatment, if subse-
quently manumitted‚ should have only the same rights as dediticii, or
enemies surrendered at discretiori ε ‘lege itaque Aelia Sentia cavetur, ut
qui servi a dominis poenae nomine vincti sint, quibusve stigmata in-
scripta sint, deve quibus ob noxam quaestio tormentis habita sit, et in

’ ea noxa fuisse convicti sint, quique ut ferro aut cum bestiis depugnarent

traditi sint, inve ludum custodiamve coniecti suerint, et postea vel ab
eodem domino vel ab alio manumissi, eiusdem conditionis liberi fiant,
cuius conditionis sunt peregrini dediticii’ Gaius i. 13. They could not
by any possibility rise to the status os cives or even of Latini 3 the statute
