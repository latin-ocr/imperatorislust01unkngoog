 

THE Emer. 31

which the praetor Atilius (ac. 2 13) directed against the encroachments
of strange religion& though a ‘ law,’ was yet an edictum repentinum.

It also became usual for each successive praetor to adopt, in sub-
stance, the edict of his predecessor, with such additionS, abrogations,
and changes as he deemed expedient. Such part of his edict as a
praetor derived from that of his predecessor in office was called
edictum tralaticium. It was owing to this fact that, though the edict
of each individual praetor had such an ephemera] validity‚ the prae·
torian law was at once so stable and yet so elastic. By the constant
accretion of new rules which legal development and increasing com·
mercial activity required, the edict assumed the form of a permanent
body of law, which had the advantage of the ius civile in the ease
with which it could be repealed, altered, or extended, and which,
therefore, apart from other considerationS, recommended itself as a
mode of legislation in many ways preferable to that of the comitia.
The danger of entrusting to the caprice of a single individual so
large a power of altering the law will strike every reader 3 but it had
two very efficient safeguardS. One of these was a strong public and
professional opinion: the other was the short duration os the praetor's
office. If one praetor ventured on innovations which were not
approved by the people or the lawyer claSS, his successor could easily
remove his obnoxious additions from the edict; for a year they would
be binding, but beyond that they had not necessarily any validity.
In point of fact, it would seem that each praetor framed his edict
after careful consultation with his friends learned in the law, and that
changes were but rarely introduced for which public opinion was not
ready3 the fact, already noticed, that each praetor always accepted a
very large portion of the edict of his predecessor, a portion, indeed,
which every year grew comparatively larger, as every year made the
edict more complete, proves that the Roman praetorS, as a class,
were the best of conservative& Cicero accuses Verres of having
issued ‘ edicta nova in re vetere,’ and altered rules for which the con-
stant acceptance os his predecessors had won the confidence and
affection of the people; but we may believe that Verres had few
imitators, and that, as a general rule, both 'parts of the edictum per-
petuum—the part which was old and the part which was new—were
alike viewed with approval by the mass of the people. Though,
however, few were guilty of Verres' breach of saith, who, according
to Cicero (in Verr. i. 46), in his judicial administration sometimes
followed a course the very opposite of that which in his edict he had
deliberately stated he intended to take, it seems that in the last cen-
