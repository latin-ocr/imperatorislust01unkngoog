EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE· 641

niary penalty, and refused or was unable to pay, the praetor would
grant possession of his estate to the quaestors, who sold it to the
highest bidder (sector). This principle was first extended to private
debts by a praetor called, according to Gaius (iv. 35), Publius Ruti-
liuS, apparently the Rutilius who was consul 13.c. 105, aster whose
reform ‘Proprietary’ execution was called bonorum emptio or ven-
ditio ¹. The procedure is sully described by Mr. Poste in the note
already referred to. The creditor or creditors were put in possession
of the bankrupt's estate by the praetor3 then, at fixed intervaIS, sol-
lowed three decrees 3 the first advertising the sale, the second autho-
rising the creditors to choose from among themselves a ‘ magister’ to
superintend it, and the last enabling them to publish the leges or
conditions under which it would take place. Finally, after a third in-
terval, the estate or universitas iuris was put up to auction, and knocked
down to the highest bidder, i. e. the person who practically offered
the creditors the highest percentage on their claimS, and who was
regarded, by a fiction, as the bankrupt's heir, in which character he
sued the debtors of the estate 3 or, as an alternative sor this fiction,
he might employ the formula Rutiliana (Gaius iv. 35), in which he
was represented as the insolvent’s agent, the insolvent being named
in the Intentio, and himself in the Condemnatio. These proceedings
did not exempt the aster-acquired property of the bankrupt from the
claims of his creditorS‚ who could take action against him repeatedly
until they had been satisfied in sull; and in consequence of thern he
became infamis For many years creditors seem to have had the
privilege of choosing between the two systemS, the debtor having no
means of saving himself from the semi-servitude of the older procedure
if his adversary preferred it to bonorum venditio 3 but by the introduc-
tion of cessio bonorum, under one os the first two Caesam, this ceased
to be the case under ordinary circumstances. The nature of cessio
bonorum has already been described in the note upon Bk. iii. 12 supr.

It has been observed that (apart from certain exceptional cases
under the legis actio procedure) we meet with no execution for debr
proper until the empire. It then became usual sor the magistrate,
upon the application of a judgment creditor, to send an officer of
the court (apparitor, viator) to seize as much os the debtor's property
as would cover the debt. This was held for two months by way of
pledge or security, at the end of which, in default of payment, it was

² The acts of bankrnptcy, as they might be called, upon which bonorum venditio
lay are speeified by Gaius (iii. 78), the cases being those of a debtor absconding
(latitans) or indefensus, a judgment debt unsatisfied for thirty dayS, and decease of
the debtor leaving no lawful successor civil or praetorian.
