1 ex eo obligatio nec mandati inter vos actio nascitur. Man-
dantis tantum gratia intervenit mandatum, veluti si quis tibi
mandet, ut negotia eius gerereS, vel ut fundum ei emereS, vel

2 ut pro eo spondereS. Tua et mandantis, veluti si mandet
tibi, ut pecuniam sub usuris crederes ei, qui in rem ipsius
mutuaretur, aut si volente te agere cum eo ex fideiussoria
causa mandet tibi, ut cum reo agas periculo mandantiS, vel ut
ipsius periculo stipuleris ab e0‚ quem tibi deleget in id quod

3 tibi debuerat. Aliena autem causa intervenit mandatum,

§L The use of ‘sponderes' is mere pedantry3 in Dig. 17. 1. 2. 1 ;
ib. 6. 2 ; ib. 8. 8, and other passages relating to this subject, we read only
of fideiussio, The second of the three instances given here may be
illustrated thus, Α, becomes surety (fideiussor) to you fo'r B, who owes
you 50l. : on your proposing to sue him on this eontract of suretyship,
he commissimus you (mandat) to sue B,· the principal debtor‚ in lieu of
him at his (A’s) risk. This is to A’s interest, because he is protected
from your action at any rate for a time, an advantage which he could not
have otherwise secured, as Nov. 4 had not yet introduced the beneficium
ordinis (p. 413 supr.) ; and he is altogether so protected if B proves solvent.
It is to your interest, because the mandate may and. probably will contain
more favourable conditions than the fideiussio, e. g. the security of a hy-
potheca (ὑπόθου γὰρ ὅτι ἡ ἐγγὺη γέγονε δίχα ὑποθήκης, τὸ δὲ μάνδατον μετὰ
ὑποθῆκης Theoph.), and before Justinian's legislation it would have been
most advantageous to you is you had been in doubt which was solvent,
A or B, for in virtue os it you could first sue B without risk, and then, if
he proved to have insufficient assetS, you could sue A by actio mandati,
which you could not have done by action on the· guaranty‚ because he
was released as fideiussor by litis contestatio with B. This was remedied
by Justinian in Cod. 8. 42. 28 ‘generaliter sancimuS, quemadmodum in
mandatoribus statutum est, ut, contestatione eontra unum ex his facta,
alter non liberetur, ita et in fideiussoribus observari)

To explain the third instance we will suppose that A owes 501. to B,
who owes the same sum to C. B gives a commission to C to stipulate
from A at his (B’s) risk that he (A) will pay him (C) the 501. which he
owes Β ; ‘ delegare est vice sua alium reum dare creditori vel cui iusserit ’
Dig. 46. 2. 11. As Mr. Poste points out, the result of this transaction,
compounded of mandate and stipulation‚ is two novationS, extinguishing
the original debts os A to Β, and B to C, and ereating two new liabilities‚
a debt of 501. owed by A to C, and a mandate between B and C under
which B is guarantor of A3 it is to B’s interest, because he, is released
from the action on the debt to C, which might have been stricti iuris,
and to which he was immediately liahIe, and can only be sued, if at all,
by actio mandati, which is bonae fidei ; it is favourable to C, because he
thereby gets two debtors (a principa] and a surety) instead of one.

§3. If A commissioned B to do something for C, he had no rights
