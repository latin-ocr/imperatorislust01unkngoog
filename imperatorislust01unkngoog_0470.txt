458 EXCURSUS JV.

In the two cases hitherto considered (legitimi ‘and secundum tabulas)
it was unlikely that the other party, who knew he was not heir,
would persist in the litigation 3 thus bonorum possessio became more
than interim possession, it had grown into an independent and im·-
pregnable interest. In this form it was employed by the praetor in
favour of other persons to whom, though not heredeS, it seemed
equitable to give a deceased man's property, which must often have
become vacans, the prey of any occupant (Gaius ii. 52—56), by default
of successors whom alone the narrow system of the Twelve Tables
regarded as having any title. If there were no legitimus, the posses-
sion was promised to the nearest cog‘nateS, and, failing them, to the
survivor of a married couple (vir et uxor); and in these caseS, there
being ex hypothesi no heir to dispute the award, bonorum possessio
lost its character as a merely provisional interest, and the mutio
which had been required from the grantee was dispensed with.
Mor-cover, by this development persons were benefited of whom the

civil law had taken no notice, whence doubtless bonorum possessio ·

came definitely to be regarded as an independent scheme of suc-
cession‚ standing in contrast with that of the Twelve Tables. The
bonorum possessio of liberi, and that of contra tabulaS, both of which
were corrigendi iuris civilis gratia, seem to have been introduced

no earlier than the fall of the Republic‚ though the latter may have
existed from the first in favour of the praeteritus suus ‚or sua.

Eventually, too, bonorum possessio secundum tabulas underwent im-
portant modificationS. Originally, it was granted to an institutus in
a will sealed by seven witnesses‚ whether the latter was valid iure
civili or not3 with this question the praetor did not concern him·
self, leaving it to be settled by the civil law claimant ab intestato, if
there were one, bringing hereditatis petitio. After contratabular
possession had been introduced, it was granted to the propounder
of the will if no one claimed contra tabulas. Hadrian enacted by a
rescript (Dig. 28. 3. 12. pr.) that if a will were ruptum agnatione
postumi, and the postumus pre-deceased the testator, the bonorum
possessor secundum tabulas should be protected against the person
claiming ab intestat0, unless a suus had been disinherited in the will.
A rescript of M. Aurelius (Gaius ii. 119—121) further provided that
bonorum possessio under a praetorian testament (septem signis sig-
natum) should hold good even against the agnates: it availed against
the institutus in a formally valid prior will only if the person in·
stituted in the praetorian testament was also entitled ab intestato. In
all other cases the intestate civil law heirs prevailed over the bonorum
