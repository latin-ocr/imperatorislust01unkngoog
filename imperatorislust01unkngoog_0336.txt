person has merely Detention, without the animus; he then determines
to hold sor himself exclusively; the Detention is converted into ljos·
session (for the analogous case of detention passing into dominium
see Title 1. 44 supr.). Where A has detention of an object which B
possesses (e. g. if he is B’s lessee), and it is then agreed that A shall
possess instead os detain, A becomes possessor rpsosacto. This is
called traditio brevi manu 3 but the sole will os a person who detains
by permission or on behalf of another cannot, by itself, give him
Possession ε see (3) p. 326 inf.

The animus domini implies voliti0n; hence· from lack of this power
the following classes cannot acquire Possession: (ι) Juristic persons,
Dig. 41. a. 1. ²23 (2) persons os unsound or weak intellect, ib. r. 33
(3) pupilli of tender age, unless they have their guardians’ auctorit& ;
(4) persons in potestas, or manuS, cannot acquire more than Detention 3
sor, being incapable of holding property, they are incapable of animus
domini, except in relation to peculium castrense or quasi castrense3
⁴ qui in aliena potestate sunt, rem peculiarem tenere possunt, habere et
possidere non possunt, quia possessio non tantum corporis sed et
iuris est ' Dig. 4¹· 2. 49. 1. Again, certain things are excluded from
possession on this ground, viz. res extra commercium; ·and the
animus domini is inconceivable in relation to an object which cannot
itself be conceived as a single individual thing. Hence the question
aristes, how far is it possible to acquire Possession of a single part of
a whole? Where the single part is to be possessed alone, this is
possible (ι) where the part is in point os sact a whole itself: e. g. a
plot of land of definite extent, which the previous possessor happens
to have treated as part of a larger whole: and (a) where the division
of the whole into parts is merely intellectual, provided the ideal part
to be possessed is precisely conceived as a definite fraction of that
whole. But where the part is to be possessed in and through the
whole, the rule is, that though the whole is possessed, the parts
individually are not. For applications of this principle, which is of
great importance in the usucapio of buildings, see Poste, Gaius
PP·⁶4⁷-8·

We can also acquire Possession through other persons as well as
through ourselves. For this the following conditions must be
satisfied:

(1) The other person (whom for convenience sake we will call the
agent) must have Detention, and also intend to acquire Possession for
the principal.

(2) The principal, or would—be possessor, must intend to acquire
