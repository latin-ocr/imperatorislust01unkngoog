in obligationem deduci nullo modo possunt. Si quis alium 3
daturum facturumve quid spoponderit, non obligabitur, veluti
si spondeat Titium quinque aureos daturum. quodsi effecturum
se, ut Titius daret, spoponderit, obligatur. Si quis alii, quam 4
cuius iuri subiectus sit, stipuletur, nihil agit. plane solutio
etiam in extranei personam conferri potest (veluti si quis ita
stipuletur ‘ mihi aut Seio dare spondes? ’), ut obligatio quidem

cium by the stipulator: cf. inf. ‘commercium adipisci stipulator.' For the
ground of nullity of such a condition as ‘ si ex libero servus fiat,’ already
stated on § 1, cf. Dig. 45. 1. 83. 5 ‘ut ne haec quidem stipulatio de
homine libero probanda sit, illum cum servus erit dare spondes? . . . quia
ea duntaxat quae natura sua possibilia sunt deducuntur in obligationem,
. . . et casum adversamque fortunam spectari hominis liberi neque civile
neque naturale est,’ Dig. 50. 17. 29 ‘quod initio vitiosum est, non potest
tractu temporis convalescere) A stipulation for conveyance of res sua
which the stipulator believed to be aliena was void because ‘id quod
alicuius est ei dari non potest :’ to make a man owner (dare) os what
was already his own was an absolute impossibility, Gaius iii. 99.

ξ 3. Α promise by A that B shall do or sorbeat as a rule imposes no
obligation on either A or B ι but

(1) A will be bound (a) if his promise is secured by a poena, ξ 21 inf„
Dig. 45. 1. 38. 2: (b) if he promises either expressly (as is said in the
text) or impliedly to get B to do the act: for the readiness with which
such a promise would be implied εἰ Dig. 45. 1. 81. pr. ‘quotiens quis
alium sisti (shall appear in court) promittit nec adicit poenam . . . .
quaeritur an committatur stipulatio: et Celsus ait, etsi non est huic
stipulationi additum “nisi steterit, poenam dari,” in id, quanti interest
sisti, contineri . . nam qui alium sisti promittit, promittit id se acturum,
ut stet!

(2) B will be bound (a) if Α is his messenger, intermediary, or agent :
see Excursus IX at the end of this Book. If A acts as his negotiorum
gestor (unauthorized agent) and B refuses to ratify, A is answerable sor
loss accruing to the promisee only if the latter believed him to be
authorized ; (b) if he is A’s heir z for this see ξ 13 and notes inf.

Sometimes, however, a person incurred liability under a contract in
which he was not directly a party, and was not even so much as named :
in particular (a) the paterfamilias or dominus on certain contracts of his
son or slave, Bk. iv. 7 inf.; (b) the principal on contracts made sor him
by his agent, authorized or unauthorized (Cod. 4. 26. 7. 1.), and (c) the
pupil on reaching puberty was suable by actio utilis on contracts made
in relation to his affairs by his guardian: ‘si impuberis nomine tutor
vendiderit, evictione secuta Papinianus . . . . ait dari in eum cuius tutela
gesta sit utilem actionem, sed adicit in id demum, quod rationibus eius
accepto latum est' Dig. 21. 2. 4. 1. ε cf. Dig. 26. 7. 12. 1.
