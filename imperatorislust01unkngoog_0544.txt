5 32 INSTJTUTJONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [ub. ιν.

5 posita est. Rursus ex diverso si quiS, cum rei publicae causa
abesset vel in hostium potestate esset, rem eius qui in civitate
esset usu ceperit, permittitur dominu, si possessor rei publicae
causa abesse desierit, tunc intra annum rescissa usucapione
eam petere, id est ita petere, ut dicat possessorem usu non
cepisse et ob id suam esse rem. quod genus actionis et aliis
quibusdam simili aequit'ate motus praetor accommodat, sicut
ex latiore digestorum seu pandectarum volumine intellegere

Glicet. Item si quis in fraudem creditorum rem suam alicui
tradiderit, bonis eius a creditoribus ex sententia praesidis
possessis permittitur ipsis creditoribus rescissa traditione eam
rem petere, id est dicere eam rem traditam non esse et ob id

ξ 5. In the case here supposed the title conserred by a completed
usucapion is rescinded or cancelled by in integrum restitutio (note on ξ 33
infi), and the plain'tiff establishes his right by an ordinary vindicatio or
Publiciana according ‘to the precise nature os his interest : the assumption
by some writers of an independent action (rescissoria or contraria Publi·
cianae) has no foundation. The text speaks only of protection against
an absent person ; but the principle was applied equally in favour of
those whose property, while they were absent rei publicae causa, had
been acquired per usucapionem, Dig. 4. 6. 23. 3 3 43. 1. 15. pr.; ci: the
note on in integrum restitutiO, ξ 33 inf. For the old annus utilis justinian
substituted in all cases a quadriennium continuum, Cod. 2. 53. 7. The

references at the end of the paragraph are to Dig. 4. 6. 1. 1 ; ib. 21. pr. ;
ib. 26. 8 3 17. 1. 57: 44. 7. 35. pr.

ξ 6. Tm iusta causa of the in integrum restitutio in this caseis the dolus
os the alienee, and the creditors' acti-on, as seems clear from the text, is
in rem: though it is difficult to see why aster restitutio there was
any necessity for a fiction: cf. Bk. iii. 10. 3 and notes supr. whether
the action (as Tbeophilus says) was called Pauliana is disputed: it is
certain that there was a persona} action of the same name, and lying
under similar circumstances. So far as can be elicited from the
authorities, it seems probable that the creditors had, as against fraudu·
lent alienation by the debtor (including wrongsul payment of one or
some of them in fun when he was aware of his insolvency) (ι) an actio
Pauliana in personam, Dig. 22. 1. 38. 4 (2) an interdictum fraudator-ium,
Dig. 36. 1. 67. 1 (3) an actio in sactum available against a bona fide
alienee, Dig. 42. 8. 10. pr. (4) the in integrum restitutio mentioned in
the teait, with a view to a real action (Pauliana ?). The relation between
*these remedieS, and the precise purpose for which they were respectively
'employed‚ are so variously represented by the commentators that it is
impossible here to go further into the question. For the missio in
possessionem of creditors upon their debtors' insolvency see p. 376 supr.
