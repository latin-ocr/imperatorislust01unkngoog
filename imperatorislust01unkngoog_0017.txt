 

THE EARLY COMITJA AND PLEBS. 5

sessed of no civil rights whatever. Some sort of legal status it was
deemed requisite to give them, and this was done by placing them in
immediate relation to some paterfamiliaS, whereby he became their
patron, they his clients. But with the family of their patron they had no
connection3 their connection was with his gens; they took the gentile
name, and became his ‘ gentiles! In this way they were brought
within the protection of the law, as dependents of a citizen 3 an object
which could not have been secured except by some such device, for
the primitive Roman law recognised no claim to its support unless the
claimant could in some way show that he was within the pale of the
triba] constitution. But the clientes acquired no political rights, though
the public duty of military service was imposed upon them, and a con·
siderable force os infantry was thus added to the resources of the
state.

This process, however, of attaching all peregrini residing on Roman
soil to the populus by the tie of clientela could not be prolonged
indefinitely. circumstances were gradually augmenting the number of
non-citizens so largely as to necessitate some new mode of dealing
with these classes. The military temper and strong organization of
the Roman people resulted in a continuous addition of territory to the
domains of the city; little districts, principally of Latin population,
were constantly being annexed, and their villages razed, the inhabitants
being encouraged to flock towards Rome, because thus they could be
most easily cowed into obedience and hindered from rebellion. These
immigrants were at first settled on the stretch of land, bordering the
three hills of the populus, known from them as esquiliae3 as their
numbers swelled, king Ancus, who was afterwards honoured as the
founder os the plebs (⁸ Romuli Ancique gentem ’ Catullus 34), assigned
them the Aventine as a dwelling-place. This was the population
which became the plebs, and which played so important a part in the
strictly legal, no less than in the constitutional, history os Rome. The
question how to deal with them became daily a more pressing political
‚ problem. To incorporate them into the existing tribe-economy was,
to Roman ideaS, quite out of the question; the populus, being based
upon the gentes, was a kind of close corporation whose constitution
was limited by the definite number of gentile aggregates⁸ The plebs
then must remain a body apart from the populus, and therefore its
members could have no political rights But there seemed no reason
why the private should not be separated from the public elements of
the law; and the result—whether it should be ascribed to a happy
accident, or to the deep-seated legal instincts of the Roman race—
