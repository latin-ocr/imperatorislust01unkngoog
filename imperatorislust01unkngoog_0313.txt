missum was called a fideicommissaria hereditas if the heir was requested
to transfer either the whole inheritance, or some definite fraction of it, to
the intended beneficiary: this following the analogy of a genuine heir-
ship, in which a person is heres‘though instituted in a very small fraction
of the succession as a whole: in other ποι-(13, as a man was directus heres
who was instituted in only a tenth, or a fiftieth, of the inheritance‚ so he
was regarded as heres fideicommissarius, and entitled to a fideicommis-
saria hereditas, is the instituted heir was requested to transfer to him
some definite quota of the universal succession, see § 7 inf. Nor, as
might be hastily inserted from the text, was it essentia} that there should
be a will: a fideicommissaria hereditas could be created by a person
charging his heredes ab intestato with the restitution of the succession
either in whole or in part: ‘meminisse autern oportebit de herede instituto
senatum loqui: ideoque tractatum est apud Iulianum, ad intestatos locum
habeat: sed est verius eoque iure utimur, ut hoc senatusconsultum ad
intestatos quoque pertineat,- sive legitimi sive honorarii sint successores'
Dig. 36. 1. 6. 1 ; cf. § 10 inf.

§ 3. Before the legislation mentioned in the next section, the effect of
a request to the heres to transfer to some other person the hereditas or
some definite fraction of it had not been to produce a universal succession
in the proper sense of the term. The transfer was at that time effected
under the guise osa sale at a nominal price (‘ nummo uno ' Gaius ii. 2 52), and
the heir under the will (heres fiduciarius), and the transferee entered into a
contract by reciprocal stipulations (stipulationes quasi emptae et venditae
hereditatis); the former bargaining that he should be indemnified‚ in pro-
portion to the quota of the hereditas which he transferred, against all judg-
ments, legal expenseS, ete. incurred by him as heir, the latter, that the other
should hand over to him his due share of the present or subsc-quent
assets, and allow him if necessary to sue as his agent upon debts owed to
the testator, Gaius ii. 252· In other wordS, the maxim semel heres semper
heres was consistently adhered to: the institutus, being charged with the
transfer of so large a share of the succession that otherwise it would not
be worth his while to accept, considering the liabilities with which he was
saddled, was only induced to do so by the transferee’s expressly under-
taking to bear a fair share in all debts and other expenses which he
incurred as heir.

This section is wrongly placed, as it refers really to the law as it stood
after the passing of the SC2. Trebellianum and Pegasianum.
