PREFACE

THE text which Ι have followed is that published by
Krueger in his and Mommsen’s Edition of the Corpus iuris
civilis (Berlin, 1877). In writing the Introductions‚ Commen-
tary, and Excursus, Ι believe Ι have consulted the best and
most recent authorities: perhaps my obligation throughout is
heaviest to Puchta (on whose masterly Institutionen, Book 11,
the General Introduction is mainly based), Schrader, Baton,
and Vangerow. My constant difficulty, in explaining the
text, has been to know where to draw the line between noteS,
in the ordinary sense os the word, and a more systematic
treatment os legal topics. Is Ι seem to have been too prolix,
my excuse must be the scarcity of accessible books upon the
subject in our own language. A French or German edition
of the Institutes might well have been far shorter‚ but there
the reader can be referred to systematic institutional treatises
upon points which hardly occur in our text. A book such as
Puchta’s or Kuntze's still remains to be written in English.

I have to express my thanks to Professor Bryce, M.P., the
present holder of the Chair os Civil Law in this University, for
constant encouragement and much actual assistance in my
work. Some of it he has revised with great care, and he
has benefited the whole by many valuable suggestions and
criticisms.
