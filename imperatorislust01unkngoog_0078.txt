66 INTRODUCTION.

by a brief indication of their respective subject-matter, and the ex-
cerpts from the writings of the juristS, of which the Titles consisted,
were distinguished by the name of the jurist and of the specific work
from which they were taken. Not unsrequently a single sentence was
made up out of several extractS, consisting each of a very few words
which depend for their meaning on a context supplied from one or
more other jurists ¹. The further division of longer excerpts into a
principium and numbered pangraphs, which is found in modern
editions of the Corpus iuris, is of far later origin.

The whole work was called Pandectae or Digesta, the latter name
being derived perhaps from Justinian's expression in the ordinance
appointing the commission (‘codex in quinquaginta libros digestus '),
or more probably from a* work of Salvius Julianus which bore the
same title. It was published on Dec. 16th, 533, with statutory force
from the 30th of the same month, and the use of the juristic writings
from which it was compiled was sor the future interdicted ; along with
the Code and the Institutes, it was intended to form the exclusive
authority for the earlier law. Though the names of their authors had
been prefixed to the individua! excerptS, Justinian ordained that they
should be taken to be immediately enacted by himself, and to derive
their force from him, not from the reputation of the jurist or from the
emperor who had conserred on him the ius respondendi3 finally, in
order to prevent all controversies in the future, he forbade all com·
mentaries on the Digest, allowing only Greek paraphrases and sum-
maries of the contents: ⁴ Omnibus similiter interdicimus, ne quis audeat
hominum, quisunt nunc, aut in posterum erunt, commentarios scri-
bere harum legum, praeterquam si velit quis in Graecam linguam
haec transferre, quem etiam volumus sola secundum pedem seu κατὰ
πόδα nuncupata uti legum interpretatione, et si quid secundum nomi-
natorum paratitlorum, ut conveniens est, adscribere voluerit usum.
Aliud autem nihil omnino ne tantillum quidem circa ea facere, nec
rursum dare seditionis et dubitationis, aut infinitae multitudinis legibus
occasionem ’ (Justinian in Const. ‘ dedit uobis? 21).

With the completion of the Code and the Digest, which between
them exhausted all the sources of Roman law, Justinian's plan was

sionem. competit mihi Publiciana ; (Ulp. loc. cit.) sed et si res iudicata sit, Pub-
liciana actio competit.
