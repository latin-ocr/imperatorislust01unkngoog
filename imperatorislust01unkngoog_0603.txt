Tit. 15] DE IN T ERDIC T IS. 591

Summa autem divisio interdictorum haec est, quod aut 1
prohibitoria sunt aut restitutoria aut exhibitoria. prohi-
bitoria sunt, quibus vetat aliquid fieri, veluti vim sine vitio
possidenti, vel mortuum inferenti, quo ei ius erit inferendi, vel

With the disappearance of the formulary system this complicated
procedure necessarily passed away3 its very complication depended on
the formula. justinian tells us himself (§ 8 inf.) that in his day interdicta
(stricto sensu) were no longer issued: in the opening paragraph os the
Title he speaks of interdicts ⁶ seu actionibus quae pro his exercentur‚’
with which may be compared the Title of Dig. 43. 1 ‘de interdictis
sive extraordinariis actionibus quae pro his competunt! An interdiu,
in his time, may fairly be described as the trial by ordinary action,
commenced in the ordinary way, of questions which in the formulary
period would have been tried in the complicated mode described by
Gaius and more particularly os questions relating to possession—‘ inter-
dicta autem licet in extraordinariis iudiciis proprie locum non habent,
tamen ad exemplum eorum res agitur’ Cod. 8. 1. 3. The only features
of difference between them and an ordinary action are t‘o be explained
by supposing that the questions on which they lay were thought to
deserve a somewhat more summary trial than others: hence the
directions in the Code (eg. 8. 1. 43 8. 2. 3; 8. 4. 8; 11. 47. 14), to
judges to try interdicts with all possible despatch‚ and the rule that the
operation of a decision on the interdict unde vi (which may be taken
as a type of the rest) shall not be suspended by appeal ; Cod. 7. 69. ’

111 qualification ofJustinian's description of interdicts under the earlier
system as ⁶ formae atque conceptiones verborum,’ it may be observed
that all orders of the praetor, like the sententia of a iudex, cod. 7. 44. 1,
had to be orally delivered, though the interdiu, being as a rule extremely
precise and technical, was committed to a written form, breviculum
or periculum, apparently as early as Cicero (in Verrem iii. 79). There
may also be a reference to the termination of interdicts (stricto sensu) in
a regular action instituted by formula (‘ concepta verba, id est per for-
mulas’ Gaius iv. 3o): cf. Gaius iv. 141, Dig. 25. 5. 1. 2; 44. 7. 37. pr.

The following sections are concerned in the main with possessory
interdicts. In ς 1 some are specified which relate to Public Lawz
others protect persona] freedom (interdictum ‘ de homine libero exhi-
bendo’ Dig. 43. 29), family rights (‘ de liberis exhibendis et ducendis’
Dig. 43. 30), and rights os property (ι de arboribus caedendis, de glande
legenda’ Dig. 43. 27 and 28) 3 and finally, some were designed to ‘sanc-
tion ’ the praetor's exercise of his own imperium : e. g. the interdicta ‘ ne
vis fiat ei qui in possessionem missus erit’ Dig. 43. 4, fraudatorium,
possessorium Gaius iv. 145, and sectoriam ib. 146.
