tore dantur, et in heredem aeque competunt aut dari solent.
est enim certissima iuris regula ex maleficiis poenales actiones

there was no rule of law providing that rights of action should be barred
unless issue were joined within a definite period from their accrual.

The praetor, however, provided that many of the new actions which
he introduced through the edict should lie only within an annus utilis
from the moment at which they first accrued, though between this period
and his own limited tenure of office there does not seem to have been the
connection suggested by Justinian in the text. By far the most im-
portant class of these annales actiones are the praetorian pena] actions,
with the exception of that on furtum manifestum, which remained per-
petua because it was in commutation of a capital penalty, Gaius iv. 111 ς
ἱίἰ. 189, but even these were perpetuae so far as they were brought only
to deprive the delinquent of any benefit he had derived from his wrong ε
‘in honorariis actionibus sic esse definiendum Cassius ait, ut quae rei
persecutionem habeant, hae etiam post annum darentur, ceterae intra
annum’ Dig. 44. 7. 35. pr. Praetorian actions which were merely uni·
laterally penal (e. g. actio doli) were prescribed in a year if contra ius
civile, Dig. ib. InterdictS, so far as they were penal, were similarly
limited: the actiones populares were all annales, Dig. 47. 23. 8: and
the prescription of the aedilician actions on sale has been already noticed‚
p. 423 supr., as also has the longi temporis praescriptio relating to actions
sor the recovery of property which had been for a defined time in the hands
of a bona fide possessor with iustus tituluS, p. 217 supr. In course of time
too a prescription was fixed by disconnected legislation for other actionS, in
particular one of five years sor the querella inofficiosi testamenti, Cod. 3.
28. 36. 2. Actions which fell under the old rule were called perpetuae,
those which were limited by any of these periods temporales.

More systematic legislation upon this matter commenced with Con-
stantine, who enacted that all real actions which were not already limited
might be repelled by an exceptio unless brought within forty years, Cod.
7. 39. 2, which subsequently seems to have been reduced to thirty, the
time here being not utile but continuum. In ΑΛ). 424 Theodosius sub-
jected to this same thirty years’ limit all actions whatsoever, with a few
exceptionS, which had hitherto been perpetuae, Cod. ib. 3. This rule is
in force under Justinian, the only actions of importance which are not
governed by it being vindicatio in libertatem, Cod. 7. 22. 3, and fiscal
claims for unpaid taxes, Cod. 7. 39. 6, which continued perpetual in the
old sense; so that in his compilations actio perpetua means an action
which is prescribed in not less than thirty years. '

For the remedies of the bonorum possessor and other praetorian suc-
cessors who feigned themselves heirs see Gaius iv. 34, 35.
