630 EXCURS vs X.

Personal actions on delict which were not penal, but reparatory (e. g.
condictio furtiva) claimed an incertum, and had a peculiar intentio
(e. g. si paret A. A : N. N. pro fure damnum decidere oportere). These
three forms of intentio in personal actions—dare, dare facere, and pro
damno decidere — correspond to the common Roman division of
obligations according as they consist in dand0, faciend0, or praestando ε
3ηά the two first, when standing alone, without the addition ⁸ ex fide
bona ’ to be shortly noticed, are characteristic os the action known in
the formulary system as condicti0. Condictio is either certi, triticea-ia,
or incerti. (1) Condictio certi corresponds to the old legis actio
introduced by the lex Silia ; it is the appropriate action for the re—
covery of certa pecunia, and its intentio runs ‘ si paret A. A. : N. N.
x milia sestertium dare oportere.¹ (2) Condictio triticaria corresponds
to the legis actio as extended by the lex Calpurnia, and lies ἴοι· the
recovery of certa res : its intentio runs ‘ si paret A. A. : N. N. fundum,
hominem, tritici x modios dare oportere.’ (3) Condictio incerti is the
remedy where the obligation is to perform some personal act other
than a conveyance, and is usually brought upon a stipulation ; hence
its more common name is actio ex stipulatu3 the form os the intentio
is ‘ quicquid dare facere . . . oportet!

iii. Condictiones are called stricti iuris iudicia. Contrasted with
them is another class of actions in personam, descended from iudicis
arbitrive postulati0, and called sometimes arbitria, but more properly
bonae fidei iudicia¹. They are enumerated in Gaius iv. 62, Bk. iv.
6. 28 supr„ the commonest of them being the actions on contracts iun's
gentium exclusive of mutuum. The name is derived from the addition
of the words ‘ ex fide bona ⁹ in the Intentio (e. g. quicquid ob eam rem
A. A. : N. N. ex fide bona dare facere oportet), which indicate that
the plaintiff’s demand is os something more ‘incertum ' even than
in condictio incerti 3 its value is to be ascertained only by a careful
balancing and adjustment of conflicting claimS, and consequently the
judge is here allowed a sar greater latitude of discretion 3 the procedure
is that os equity rather than of law ².

iv. Another division os actions based upon structural difference of
Intentio is that into actio directa and actio utilis, which grew out of
the practice of extending an action to cases which did not come within

¹ The term arbitrium in Roman law, in the sense οῖ an action. means either an
actio arbitraria, p. 545 supr„ or a bonae fidei iudicium3 and the person who tria
an action of either of these classes is called arbiter as osten as iudex.

fidei iudicia see on Bk. iv. 6. 28 supr.
