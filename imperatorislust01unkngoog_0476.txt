gati 'naturaliter’ Dig. 4. 5. 2. 2; this, however, ceased to be of im·
portance when in integrum restitutio of the creditors had become
usual under such circumstances, see p. 372 supr. (b) Other instances
are supplied by the law of procedure. If a Judge erroneously de-
cided an action so as to aequit a debtor who, as a fact, was liable,
the latter remained bound naturaliter, Dig. 60. 12. 2; 28. 12. 6,
though this is denied by some writers. So, t00, an obligation con-
tinued to exist as naturalis after it had ceased to be actionable
through either the rules for the prescription of actions, or the opera-
tion of litis contestatio (Gaius iii. 180) or res iudicata, Dig. 12. 6. 60.

The legal effects of natural obligation have as yet been defined
only negatively3 it did not entitle the creditor to sue. As to its
positive effects, no general rule can be laid down for all cases: they
must be determined for each case individually‚ for the creditor's right,
in one instance, may have a greater or less orbit than in another;
in other wordS, apart from the right of action, a natural obligation
may possibly entitle him to all or any of the rights which he would
have were the debitor bound civiliter, or possess all or any of the sol-
lowing properties:

(1) It excludes condictio indebiti (note on Bk. iii. 14. 1), i.e. if
money is owed naturaliter only, and is paid, even by mistake, it
cannot be recovered on the ground that it is not due: ⁸ naturales obli-
gationes non eo solo aestimantur, si actio aliqua earum nomine
competit, verum etiam cum soluta pecunia repeti non potest ' Dig.
46. 1. 16. 4.

(2) It can be set off against an actionable claim of the debtor on
the creditor, e. g. is A owes B 1ol. naturaliter, and B owes A sol.
civiliter, B on being sued by A can set the 1oI. off against the sol„
though he cannot directly sue for it himself: ‘ etiam ‘quod natura debe-
tur venit in compensationem ⁹ Dig. ib. 265 cf. Bk. iv. 6 39 inf.

(3) It forms a sufficient basis for those other rights which can only
come into existence under the condition that there is already an
actual obligation in esse, viz. pledge, Dig. 2ο. 1. 55 guarantee (‘ at ne
illud quidem interest, utrum civilis an naturalis sit obligatio cui adici·
atur fideiussor’ Bk. iii. 20. 1 3 so t00, with constitutum, for which see
on Bk. iii. 20. 9), and novation (Bk. iii. 29. 3, Dig. 39. 5. 19. 4); by
constitutum a natural can be converted into a civil obligation by a
mere formless second promise by the debtor, Dig. 13. 5. 1. 7.

(4) Deductio de peculio. Contracts between a paterfamilias and
his filius, or between a master and his slave, produced natural obliga-
