obligatio durat et ideo ipso iure postea de eadem re adversm
te agi potest: sed debes per exceptionem rei iudicatae ad-

from Dig. 44. 2. 3. (1) The right asserted in the second action must he
the same as that asserted in the first. For instance, the res has not been
iudicata, because the quaestio is not eadem, if what was decided in me
first suit was a question of possession, while in the second we have a
question of ownership‚ Dig. 44. 2. 14. 3, or where a condictio relates to
the same object which has previously been claimed by vindieatiq Dig.
ib. 1 ι. 6. But, granted that the right alleged is the same, it is immaterial
that the second action is of a different nature from the first : ‘ de eadem
re agere videtur et qui non eadem actione agit, qua ab initio agebat, sed
etiam si alia experiatur, de eadem tamen re' Dig. ib. 5. For example
of difference of actions involving the same right cs. Dig. 44. 2. 3. 7 (here-
ditatis petitio and vindicatio) ; ib. 8 (hereditatis petitio and actio familiae
erciscundae); ib. 24 (vindicatio and actio Publiciana). Granted, again,
that the right alleged is the same, it is immaterial that in the first action
a point was deeided incidentally only which forms the principal question in
the second, though by the praescriptio praeiudicii orexceptiopraeiudicialis
(Cic. de invent. 2. 20) the defendant was enabled to postpone such inci-
dental determination of an issue which was all-important in anoth&
suit.

It is often said that the identity of the object to which the right in
either action relates is an essential condition of exceptio rei iudicatae ; ας.
‘ curn quaeritur, haec exceptio noceat necne? inspiciendum est an idern
corpus sit' Dig. 44. 2. 12 3 but, though it may usually be insen-ed that
the quaestio is eadem from the identity of the reS, it is really immaterial
that the res are different if the right is substantially identical in the two
actions ; e. g. isa plaintiff demands first the whole, and later a part os that
whole, Dig. ib. 7. pr„ or if he claims first an ancilla, and then a child
conceived by her after litis contestatio in that action, ib. 7. 1, the ex·

. ceptio can be pleaded with effect.

1f the right alleged in the two actions is the same, but is based, in the
second, upon a different title from that affirmed in the first, a distinction
must be drawn between real and persona] actions. If the action was
real, the defendant was not estopped from pleading the exceptio by the
difference os title, sor the right is the same however it may have been
acquired : ‘ neque enim amplius quam semel res mea esse potest ς’ and
consequently ‘ omnes causae (titles) una petitione apprehenduntur ' Dig.
44. 2. 14. 2. The only exception to this rule under the older law was,
that where the title advanced in the second had accrued since the
decision in the first action (causa superveniens) ; later it seems to have
been allowable to specisy a single title in a real action (eausa expressa
agere), the plaintiff thereby being held to save his right of subsequently
claiming the same property by a different one, Dig. 44. 2. 11. 2 ; ib. 14. 2.
But in obligations the plaintifl's right differs with the mode in which the
particular obligation arose ε ‘ actiones in personam ab actionibus in rem
