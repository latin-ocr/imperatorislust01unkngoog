636 EXCURS vs X.

in personam based upon a wager. The claimant of property chal·
lenged his opponent to a bet upon the title: si homo, quo de agitur,
ex iure Quiritium meus est, sestertios xxv nummos dare spondes?
(Gaius iv. 93); and it was upon this promise that the suit was
brought, so that the action, though its proper and ultimate object
was a real right, in form was in personam. To secure delivery of
the object, along with its fruits and accessione, in the event of the
plaintiff’s success the defendant had personally to give security (pro
praede litis et vindiciarum), and the amount os the wager‚ being
merely trifling, was never exacted, whence its name sponsio prae-
iudicialis. For the same reason there was no restipulatio by the
defendant, as in condictio certi ¹.

It remains to notice certain clauses which were sometimes inserted
in the formula at the instance οἱ the defendant, viz. exceptiones and
praescriptiones pro τεο. It was a peculiar rule of the formulary
system that the defendant was not allowed to plead some grounds
of defence in iudicio unless they had been alleged in iure, and the
judge’s attention expressly called to them by an addition to the
formula. Exceptiones are pleas of this character: defences which
do not actually traverse the allegation of the plaintiff, but set up a
countervailing right, rendering the former of at least no present value,
and which, if they are to be successfully pleaded, require (though to
a larger extent in some classes of actions than in others) to be tersely
embodied in the formula, by an addition to the Intenti0, instructing
the iudex to condemn the defendant only on the fulfilment of two
conditions instead, as usual, of one, viz. (a) a positive condition, si
paret, etc.: (b) a negative condition, non-proot' by the defendant of

¹ It was but seldom, as has been observed above, that a formula consisted of all
the four ordinary elements (demonstratio, intentio, adiudicatio, condemnatio) al-
ready doecribed. The composition os the different classes of formula may be sum-
marised thus :—

(a) Those of (1) real actionS, (2) personal actions which are certae and in ius con-
ceptae, and (3) actions in sactum conceptae, have only intentio and condemnatio.

(b) Those of personal actions which ane in ius conceptae, but incertae. have, as a
general rule, demonstratio, intentio, and condemnatio; the iudicia divisoria, which
belong to this class, have an adiudicatio as well.

(c) Praeiudicia (for which see Gaius iv. 44) have only an intentio. Thus

The Demonstratio never stands alone5 it occurs only in persona! actions which
have an intentio incerta in ius concepta. and a civile nornen (sor in desault of this
its place is supplied by praescripta verba, p. 633 supn).

The Intentio is found in every formula.

The Adiudicatio occurs only in formulae of iudicia divisoria3 and

The condemnatio concludes every formula except those of praeiudicia. but can-
not stand alone.
