EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 629

be distinguished from the other parts of the formula by the term paret
(si paret, quicquid paret) ; and if it affirms a right, it is said to be ‘ in
ius concepta,' if it merely implies a right by directing the J’udge to
decide for or against the plaintiff according as he finds certain alleged
facts to be true or untrue, it is said to be ‘ in factum concepta! The
numerous divisions of Roman actions found in the fourth book of
Gaius are based almost entirely on the structure of the intentio; for
this being the part of the formula in which we find, expressly or
impliedly, the right alleged by the plaintiff, it is by reference to it
that we are enabled to distinguish actions according to the rights
which they are designed to protect. If the intentio of one formula
differs substantially in structure from that of another, we know at once
that the actions themselveS, and the rights which they respectively
protect, are substantially different as well.

The principal divisions of actionS‚ so far as they arise from differ-
ences of structure in the intenti0, are as follow.

i. The intentio is either directed against the person of the defend-
ant, and names him (e. g. si paret Aulum Agerium Numerio Negidio
sestertium x millia dare oportere), or it merely specifies the object to
which the plaintifl's claim relates (e. g. si paret Auli Agerii hominem,
fundum,hereditatem, ius utendi fruendi,esse). In the first case the action
is in personam, and brought to enforce an obligation ; it Is called ‘actio '
κατ’ ἐξοχῆν (ρ. 33² supr.). In the second case it is in rem, and asserts
either ownership or a ius in re aliena as belonging to the plaintiff ;
its specific name is vindicatio or petitio, A real action claiming a
servitude was called actio (in rem) consessoria3 one denying the right
of another person was called negativa or negatoria.

ii. Certain actions in personam are divided into certae and incertae,
according as the act claimed by the plaintiff relates to a certum (res or
pecunia) or an incertum. In the former case—if, that is to say, the
obligation of the defendant was to pay an ascertained sum of money,
or to transfer a res or a definite amount of some reS, such as corn,
wine, or oil, the intentio ran ‘ si paret (reum). . . dare oportere ; ’ and
is the certum were money, the action was substantially identical with
the old condictio under the lex Silia, and involved a penal sponsio and
restipulatio of a third of the sum in dispute. In the latter case—if,
that is to say, the obligation of the defendant was incertum, i. e. not
to transfer such or such res or pecunIa, but to perform some other
personal act or service—the proper word for the intentio was not
dare, but facere, though the two were here usually combined, so that
the intentio ran ⁸ quicquid paret N. N. ι Α. Α. dare facere oportere.’
