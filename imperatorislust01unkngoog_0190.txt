178 INTRODUCTION To BOOK II.

Tables--uti legassit super pecunia tutelave suae rei, ita ius esto—and
is expounded at length in Titles 1o-2 5. Certain abnormal caseS‚ in

which a person, though not owner, may, or, though owner, may not
alienate, are noticed in Tit. 8. But the bulk of the text relating to

dominium is taken up by the modeS, natural and civil, original and
derivative, in which it may be acquired, the preponderance of natural
over civil titleS, as compared with the law of Gaius' age, being par-
ticularly noteworthy. Titles 3-5 relate to the fragments os ownership
called servitudeS, which correspond very roughly to the easements
and profits os English Law. Title 9 discusses the question of agency
in the acquisition of ownership, and states the changes which had
taken place since Gaius in the proprietary capacity of filiifamilias3
here too we get a reference to Possession‚ which is not treated in
extenSO‚ but a knowledge of its rules is presupposed in the Title on
Usucapio, and is supplied in an Excursus below.

The transition from modes ‘ quibus res singulae adquiruntur’ to
those ‘ quibus adquiruntur per universitatem,’ brings us to the law of
Inheritance3 the rules which prescribe the devolution of a man's
universitas iuris on his decease. This may take place either ex
testamento or ab intestato: the exposition os testamentary succession
occupies the remainder of the Book. Firstly (Title 10), are described
the solemnities necessary for the execution of a valid will, the
qualification required in the witnesses taking up some considerable
space3 but from these formalities soldiers, while on actual service,
are exempt‚ and Title 1 1 points out the chief anomalies involved in
this exemption. In Title 12 are stated the qualifications required in
the testator, such as puberty and ‘ testamentisacti0,' and the special
precautions to be observed in the execution of a blind man's will are
alluded ιο. Four successive Titles then explain the most ordinary
contents os a testament, viz. exheredation of sui heredes whom
the testator wishes to exclude from all share in his succession
(Title 13) ; the institution of the heres or universal successor (Title 14);
substitutions ‘vulgar’ (Title 15) and ‘ pupillary ' (Title 16), answering
in some degree to the remainders so sarniliar in English deeds and
wills. Title 17 enumerates the modes in which a testament might
be or become void, such as original informality, revocation, sub-
sequent birth os a suus hereS, and capitis deminutio of the testator:
and in Title 18 is discussed the querella inofficiosi testamenti, the right
of certain relatives of the deceased to impeach and upset his will, for
not having left them a certain minimum of his property. The
division of heredes into necessarii, sui et necessarii, and extranei, the
