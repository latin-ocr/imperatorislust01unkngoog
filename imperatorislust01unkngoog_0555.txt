Tit. ⁶.] DE ACTIONJB css, 543

constitutio aperte eam esse bonae fidei disposuit. Fuerat 29
antea et rei uxoriae actio ex bonae fidei iudiciis: sed cum
pleniorem esse ex stipulatu· actionem invenientes omne iuS,
quod res uxoria ante habebat, cum multis divisionibus in ex
stipulatu actionem, quae de dotibus exigendis proponitur,
transtulimuS, merito rei uxoriae actione sublata ex stipulatu,
quae pro ea introducta est, naturam bonae fidei iudicii tantum
in exactione dotis meruit, ut bonae fidei sit. sed et tacitam
ei dedimus hypothecam: praeferri autem aliis creditoribus in
hypothecis tunc censuimuS, cum ipsa mulier de dote sua ex-
periatur, cuius solius providentia hoc induximus, In bonae 30
fidei autem iudiciis libera potestas permitti videtur iudici ex
bono et aequo aestimandi, quantum actori restitui debeat. in
quo et illud continetur, ut, si quid invicem actorem praestare
oporteat, eo compensato in reliquum is cum quo actum est
condemnari debeat. sed et in strictis iudiciis ex rescripto divi
Marci opposita doli mali exceptione compensatio inducebatur.

The SC. Juventianum passed under Hadrian first gave hereditatis
petitio a mixed character (Dig. 5. 3. 20. 6) by enabling the heir to
recover from other persons all advantage which they had derived from
res hereditariae which they ·no longer possessed (e. g. which they had
sold); they came, in fact, to be regarded somewhat in the light of the
heir’s negotiorum gestoreS, and, therefore, were bound as such to
surrender to him all profit which they had made by intersering in
business which was not their own. It would seem that, in prosecuting
s‘uch claimS, the action, being in effect in personam, was conducted on
bonae fidei principles, so that the question arose, which Justinian deter-
mined by Cod. 3. 31. 12. 3, whether it was not itsels bonae fidei.

ξ 29. The actio rei uxoriae (sor the scope os which see p. ¹23 supr.) is
not. so often said to be bonae fidei as to belong to a cognate class of
actions ‘in bonum et aequum conceptae ’ Dig. 4. 5. 8 ; 24. 3. 66. 7, among
which were also the actio iniuriarum aestimatoria, Dig. 47. 10. 11. 1 ; the
actio de effusis, Dig. 9. 3. 1. pr., and the aedilician action mentioned in
Tit. 9. 1 inf. 3 in these the discretion of the judge was freer even than in
bonae fidei actions proper. By substituting the actio ex stipulatu de
dotibus exigendis (which naturally was stricti iuris) for the actio rei
uxoriae Justinian fictitiously represented the restoration of the dos as
having been promised by stipulation with a clausula doli, whereby it
acquired the bonae fidei character which he here expressly gives it. The
superiority of the actio ex stipulatu had consisted in its being trans-
missible to heirs >and in some other points noticed in Cod. 5. 13. 3-10.
