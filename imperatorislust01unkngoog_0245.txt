. Tit. 9.] PER QUAS PERSONAS NOBIS ADQUJRJTUR. 233

Hactenus tantisper admonuisse sufficiat, quemadmodum 6
singulae res adquiruntur: nam legatorum ius, quo et ipso
singulae res vobis adquiruntur, item fideicommissorum, ubi·
singulae res vobis relinquuntur, opportunius inferiori loco refere-
mus. videamus itaque nunc, quibus modis per universitatem
res vobis adquiruntur. si cui ergo heredes facti sitis sive cuius
bonorum possessionem petieritis vel si quem adrogaveritis vel
si cuius bona libertatum conservandarum causa vobis addicta
fuerint, eius res omnes ad vos transeunt. ac prius de here-
ditatibus dispiciamus. quarum duplex condicio est ε nam vel
ex testamento vel ab intestato ad vos pertinent. et prius est,
ut de his dispiciamus, quae vobis ex testamento obveniunt.

hear of his so acquiring even possession, the old maxim being ‘per ex·
traneam personam nihil adquiri potest) Such extraneae personae had
always been able to retain for a man a possession which he had validly
got sor himself ε and it would seem that soon after the establishment of
the empire (Dig. 41. 2. 51) it was attempted by an extension of the
principle to break down the old rule as to the original acquisition of
possession, and thus to get over the necessity of a double traditio. Labeo
seems by implication (Dig. loc. cit.) to have favoured the proposed inno·

· vation, which was also approved by Javolenus. Neratius, writing under

Trajan, says ‘ per procuratorem possessionem adipisci nos iam sere con-
venit' Dig. 41. 3. 41 ε Gaius (ii. 95) refers to the controversy as still
unsettled ε but Paulus (sent. rec. 5. 2. 2), Ulpian (Dig. 41· 1. 20. 2), and
Modestinus (ib. 5 3), assert the new doctrine as though in their day it was
completely and universally recognised. Thus the constitution of Severus
(Cod. 7. 32. 1) alluded to in the text did not make new law, but was merely
a statutory confirmation of a principle already sufficiently established by
juristic consensus, as indeed its terms themselves allow. Its importance
was that, in respect of all objects in which ownership could be transferred
by mere traditio, even ownership could be acquired for one by an extranea
persona: ‘ ea quae civiliter adquiruntur per eoS, qui in potestate nostra
sunt, adquirimus, veluti stipulationem (mancipationem ?) 3 quod natural·
iter adquiritur, sicu'ti est possessio, per quemlibet volentibus nobis
possidere adquirimus' Modestinus in Dig. 41. 1. 53. When, as under
Justinian, traditio was the universal mode of transferring dominium in res
corporaleS, delivery of possession to one’s agent, if the transferor was
owner, was delivery of ownership to oneself: if he was not, all that one
got was possession, which, however, usucapio could convert into owner-
ship 2 but usucapio did not begin to run until the acquisition of possession
by· the agent was made known to the principal, Cod. 7. 32. 1.

ξ Θ. Justinian now proceeds to discuss universal successions, or the
modes in which a man's entire proprietary relations—his property and
his rights and liabilitles, so sar as they are not purely persona-pass
