hence no one can stand in this relation to a mere right (p. 209 supr.).
The right to interdicte, however, was grounded upon a disturbance in
some unlawful manner of the exermis-e os ownership, and the exercise
of other rights, as well as that of ownership, can be unlawfully dis-
turbed ; so that it seemed only logical that here too unwarranted
interference should be guarded against by the same remedies. Accord-
ingly, the enjoyment os iura in re aliena was protected by possessory
interdicts; they were deemed to be quasi-possessed (‘ iuris quasi pos-
sessio ⁹ Dig'. 8. 5. ro, ‘possessionem vel corporis vel iuris ’ Dig. 43. 26.
a. 3). The expression, as Savigny remarks, is an improper extension
of analogica] language3 quasi possessio indicates the exercise of a ius
in re aliena, being related to the latter in the same way as possession
stra-to sensu is to dominium. N or is it possible to ‘ detain ’ an object
which, though corporeal, is indeterminate, such as an uncertain por-
tion os a thing. F inally, the idea os detention being that of exclusive
physica] control, we have the rule ‘ plures eandem rem in solidum
possidere non possunt ς ’ i. e. if we read that a previously existing
possession (and a fortiori detent10n) still continues, no new possession
(and asortiori detention) can possibly have commenced; and con-
versely, if the law recognises a new possession, the previous possession
must have ceased to exist.

When to this Detention is superadded a further (mental) clement, it
becomes Possession, an interest protected by special legal remedieS,
viz. interdicts. That mental clement is the intention, on the part of
the derainer, of dealing with the thing detained as owner; os exercis-
ing over it, on his own behalf, the rights which an owner exercises on
his. This intention is usually called the animus domini or sibi
habendi; the phrase does not occur in the authorities, the nearest
approach to it being Theophilus' νέμεσθαί ἐστι τὸ ψυχῇ δεσπόζοντος mr·
ἇχσιν. It should carefully be marked, that it is an intention ; it has
nothing to do with a belief that one is owner (opinio or cogitatio
domini), for the possessing thies or robber is as capable of the animus
domini as the most innocent possessor, and is as sully entitled to the
protection os interdicts as the latter; ‘ adversus extraneos vitiosa
possessio prodesse solet ' Dig. 4¹· 2. 53. In other words possession
is independent of bona fides: ‘ it is possession, whether iusta or iniusta ;'
the ius possessionis, the right involved in possession, the right pro·
tected by interdicts, is quite distinct from and independent os the ius
possidendi, or right to possesS, which belongs not to the law os pos-
session, but of ownership.

Possession, then, as a legal right, consists of two elements‚ deten-
