of the two comitia which we have just been considering, the
comitia tributa, as might have been inferred from its history, con-
cerned itself mainly with ordinary domestic legislation, the great
majority of enactments which relate to private law being plebiscita3
the leading business of the comitia centuriata was the election of
magistrates and deliberation on high political matters. After the
latter assembly had acquired its full powers, the oldest gathering of
all, the comitia curiata, dropped back into a position of quite secon-
dary importance‚ and its right of independent legislation was less and
less frequently· exercised. The functions which it continued to dis-
charge were the approval of such resolutioris of the centuries as by
inveterate custom required a religious sanction, and of other legal
dispositions which were deemed incomplete unless confirmed in this
manner. The action of the curiae is in fact implicated with that of
the pontifices, to whom was first submitted any business for which it
was desired to obtain the legislative sanction of this comitia; for
instance, the form of adoption known as adrogation, and the lex
curiata de imperio, by which the higher magistrates, with the ex-
ception of the censors, were invested with their authority, both have a
religious significance. It is not known how long the patriciana con·
tinued to attend the meetings in person3 far before Cicero's time
they were merely represented by thirty lictors.

The senate apparently did not exercise any purely legislative
authority till the last century sc. Besides its important function of
discussing all matters before they were submitted to the assembly
of the centurieS, which indeed could not be so submitted at all without
a senatorial resolution ⁸ ut de ea re ad populum ferretur,' it exercise‘d a
considerable influence in this period over the elections. Originally
it nominated the candidates whose names the consul was to lay before

' the comitia3 when the plebeians became eligible to all the higher

magistr-acies, this right fell into desuetude, and free canvassing be-
came the rule. But the senate was still able to make its weight felt
through the magistrate who conducted the elections; and by the ne-
cessity of its ‘ auctoritas ⁹ it controlled the comitia curiata, whose
approval of the choice made by the centuries was given, as has just
been observed, by the lex curiata de irnperio. Even of this influence
the senate was indirectly deprived by a lex Maenia, by which it
was enacted that the senatorial auctoritas to the comitia curiata
should be given before instead of after the assembly of the centuries
in which the magistrates were elected.

The period between the reform of the comitia centuriata and the
