law, honorariae or praetoriae if their·source is the Edict of the magis-
trate, ξ 3. Real· praetorian actions are exemplified by the actionoe

Publiciana, Serviana‚ and hypothecaria, §§ 4-7 3 among those which ·

are personal are the actiones de pecunia constituta (ξ 9), de peculio
(ξ 10), and others which are penal (ξ 12).

iii. Finally‚ there is a division the origin of which is to be sought
in the formulary period, and which turns upon the nature os the pro-
cedure. Actiones arbitrariae (ξ 31) are those by which the plaintiff
obtains delivery or productiori of specific property and specific per·
formance of contract. Actions in personam are either stricti iuris

‚ or bonae fidei (ξ 28), a distinction more fully explained elsewhere¹;

the latter class is illustrated by exampleS, and the extension of one of
its leading features—set off-—to the former is noticed in ξ 30.

Lastly, thrust into this classification of actionS, in deserence to
Gaius, are one or two‘topics which would have been better discussed
in some other place. The thirty-second section, which corres-
ponds with Gaius iv. 52, should properly form part of Title 17 (‘ de
officio iudicis '); and the explanation of the effects of plus and minus
petiti0, and of erroneous as distinct from over claim (ἕξ 33-35, cor-
responding with Gaius iv. 53-60). which really is a matter of Proce-
dure, might be placed in several of the following Titles as appropri-
ately as here.

In the seventh Title are explained the so called ‘actiones adiectitiae
qualitatis,’ by which the Praetor had tempered the inequitable doctrine
of the civil law that a master or paterfamilias, though entitled to all
benefit under the contracts of his slaves or children in power, could
in no case be sued upon thern. By the actiones quod iussu, exer-
citoria, and institoria the superior became liable in solidum whenever
it could be shown that he had directed or authorized the contract.
Where a slave or filiusfamilias embarked a peculium in trade with his
master's or father's knowledge, and became insolvent, the master or
father was permitted to distribute the assets among the creditorS,
though any one of them who was dissatisfied with such distribution
was enabled by the actio tributoria to bring it under judicia] review=
if the pater or dominus was himself a creditor, he was entitled to no
larger dividend than the rest. Where, on the other hand, the slave
or son made the contract without the superior’s knowledge, the latter
was liable in person by the actio de in rem verso so far as the trans·
action had resulted in a benefit to himself ; otherwise he could be
compelled only to surrender the peculium, and had the privilege of
