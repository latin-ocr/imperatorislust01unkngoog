two comitia, with their respective functione, still remained perfectly
distinct, but the centuries had been incorporated with the tribes;
Cicero (pro Plane. πο) expressly speaks os them as thus incorporated,
and in another passage alludes to the votes of the tribes in his own
election as consul. The exact date of this change. is uncertain.
Niebuhr ascribes it to the censors Fabius and Decius; Mommsen
places it somewhat earlier. Its motive was apparently the desire to
reduce the influence of moderate fortunes in the comitia, and to exalt
that of birth, lauded property, and military rank. The proprietary
qualification for even the first of the Servian classes had, through the
growing prosperity of Rome, ceased to be the measure of a consider-
able fortune οι· even the index os social respectability; thus a great mass
of the lower middle class had found its way into a body which Servius
had conceived as consisting of only the higber or richer orders. The
same observation may be made of the second and succeeding
classes; the social position of the members of this or that class had
altered along with the change in the value of money, and the relative
rank in the state of those who composed class one, and wh0, as we
have seen, formed a political force of overwhelming influence, had
fallen in proportion; the timocratic constitution remained the same,
while money had come to be worth less3 the result being a complete
change in the politica! centre os gravity. The natural remedy seemed
to be to give up, at any rate partially, the timocratic system, to di·
minish the number of the centuries, whereby the influence of the
equestrian order would be increased, and to bring them into a sub-
ordinate relation with the tribes, in whose assembly the political
preponderance lay rather with the lauded proprietorS. These at least
appear to be the general lines of the reforming ‚policy. Though the

. exact changes are more or less matter of conjecture, the best theory

of them seems to be that, while the old equestrian centuries, eighteen
in number, were left untouched, those of the five Servian classes were
distributed among the tribes and at the same time reduced in number,
there being fifty-four centuries in the rusticae, eight in the urbanae
tribus; so that the whole number of centuries would now be eighty.
The classes still voted in their old order, but speaking generally,
were, so far as related to the comitia, no longer determined by a pro-
perty qualification. The right of a citizen to vote in the comitia
centuriata depended on his being enrolled in a tribe, and to what
tribe he belonged was settled by the censors. By the year a. c. 241,

{ihc number of tribes had by successive additions been raised to thirty-
