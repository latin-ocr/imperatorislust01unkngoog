DE LOCAHONE ET coNnnc‘noNE..

Locatio et conductio proxima. est emptioni et venditioni
isdemque iuris regulis consistunt. nam ut emptio et venditio
ita contrahitur, si de pretio convenerit, sic etiam locatio et
conductio ita contrahi intellegitur, si merces constituta sit. et
competit locatori quidem locati actio, conductori vero con-

lducti. Et quae supra diximuS, si alieno arbitrio pretium
permissum suerit, eadem et de locatione et conductione dicta
esse intellegamuS, si alieno arbitrio merces permissa suerit.
qua de causa si fulloni potienda curandave aut sarcinatori
sarcienda vestimenta quis dederit nulla statim mercede consti-
tuta, sed postea tantum daturus, quantum inter eos convenerit,

was held to be conditional on its fixture existence ς eg. a crop which is

liable to be destroyed by floods: an ‘ emptio spei ³ was absolute, Dig. ,

⁸1⁸1t. XXIV. In many points», as is observed in the text, the rules of
locatio conductio are (mutatis mutandis) identieal with those os sale.
The contract is concluded as soon as the parties are agreed upon the
thing to be let and the hire money (merces), which must be pecunia
numerata, ξ 2, except that the rent of agricultural land may be paid in
kind, the amount being fixed either absolutely or at a certain proportion
of the yearly fruits‚ Cod. 4. 65. 21. So too the merces, like the pretium,
must be certa and vera, but need not be iusta, under-standing these
terms in the senses already given to them under Tit. 23; nor, finally,
need the letter be dominus os that which he lets (Dig. 19. 2. 7 3 ib. 9 pr.
and 6); else subletting would have been impossible.

Transactions of three different kinds are included under this contract:
(1) Locatio conductio rerum, the letting by one (locator) and hiring by
another (conductor) of a thing moveable or immoveable (e.g. a house
with its premiseS, in which case the hirer was called inquilinus: or
agricultural land, when he was called colonus, Bk. ii. 1. 36 supr.)‚ or
even of a res incorporalis, e. g. a usufruct, Dig. 7. 1. 12. 2 3 ib. 38.

(2) Locatio conductio operarum, the letting by one (locator) of his
services only to another (conductor), as in all contracts of free service.

(3) Locatio conductio operis», where one (conductor) engages to execute
a specific piece of work, e. g. build a house, a ship, a carriage‚ etc., for
another (locator). Here the ordinary use of the terms describing the
parties is inverted, the one who contracts to do the work, and who we
should say is hired, being regarded as the hirer.
