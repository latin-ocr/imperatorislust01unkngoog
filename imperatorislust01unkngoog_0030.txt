18 INTRODUCTION.

mancipi, we know that for many centuries a slave could not be
effectually enfranchised except by a public act; that the earliest forms
of wills were dispositions sanctioned either by direct legislative au-
thority of the populus or by its representatives, the seven witnesses
os the mancipation 3 and that the earliest mode in which a binding
contract could be concluded was possibly the so-called nexum, which
in all essential features was identical with mancipation. Thus the
authority of the populus—the sanction of public law—was required
to validate almost every dealing between man and man, whether it
was a marriage, a sale, a contract, the manumission of a slave, the
emancipation of a son, or a testamentary disposition.

The prominent influence of the plebeian element os the state in the
development os private law has been already alluded to as a fact
which by itself appears beyond question. The theory now under
discussion has the meritos explaining this fact, and of oerrying the
history of the evolution of private law even further backwards. Suits
in which relig-lons considerations or a religious sanction were involved
were submitted for decision to the pontifice3‚ presided over by the
king as pontifex maximus; and it is represented that religion occu-
pied so large a sphere in the life of early Rome that the whole of the ,
original law may be regarded as partly ius publicum, partly ius
sacrum. What was subsequently known as ‘ius privatum’ attained
a gradual recognition and advanced by timid steps to independence
under the protecting aegis of ius sacrum: ‘ius sacrum was the form
which private law at first assumed, and in which it first received an
independent though subordinate existence, as against the absorbing
and preponderating weight of ius publicum.' But the plebS, when it
became an integral part of the Roman state, was free from all pre-
judices based on the history of the populus; and ‘it was in the plebs
that the ius Quiritium, the private portion of the code, received its suu
development, and from the plebs that Rome got an idea which
perhaps otherwise she would never have got—the idea of a private
person.’ The relations os a private person must be governed by
private law, and thus it is to the plebeian element in the state that the
main institutions of private law are to be ascribed. Some of these
developments—the new forms of marriage and of adoption —have

been already suggested. But the plebs consisted of persons who .

were no part of the populus 3 exactly then as the members os the
latter (who had now come to be called patricians) could only possess
and enjoy land, but not own it, so the members of the former,
precisely because they were not of the populus, could only, if they
