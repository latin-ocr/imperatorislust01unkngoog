ut de inofficioso testamento agere non possit: sive iure here-
ditario sive iure legati vel fideicommissi, vel si mortis causa
ei quarta donata fuerit, vel inter vivos in his tantummodo

casibus, quorum nostra constitutio mentionem facit, vel aliis
modis qui constitutionibus continentur. Quod autern de 7

quarta diximus, ita intellegendum est, ut, sive unus fuerit sive
plures, quibus agere. de inofficioso testamento permittitur, una
quarta eis dari possit, ut pro rata distribuatur eis, id est pro
virili portione quarta.

DE HEREDUM QUALITATE ET DIFFERENTIA.

Heredes autern aut necessarii dicuntur aut sui et necessarii
aut extranei. Necessarius heres est servus heres institutus: 1
ideo sic appellatus, quia, sive velit sive nolit, omnimodo post
mortem testatoris protinus liber et necessarius heres fit. unde
qui facultates suas suspectas habent, solent servum suum primo

not as a rule be counted as part of the quarta, unless made propter
nuptias or by way of dos, Cod. 3. 28. 19, or unless it had been so ex-
pressly agreed between the parties, Cod. ib. 35. 23 for other exceptions
see Cod. ib. 30. 2, Cod. 6. 20. 20. pr„ Dig. 5. 2. 25. pr.

§¹¹1. The true ground of the querella inofficiosi being the testator's
impietas or want of natural affection, success depended on the plaintiff’s

ability to show ‘immerentem se et ideo et indigne praeteritum vel
etiam exheredatione summotum' Dig. 5. 2. 3: the onus of proving the
existence of reasonable grounds for the plaintiff’s exclusion lay on the
defendant (instituted heir), who might meet the plaintiff by the exceptio
ingratitudinis„ Cod. 3. 28. 19. 23.

By N ov. 1 15. 3-5 Justinian made a considerable change in this branch
of law3 he required that ascendants should not only leave descendants
the quarta (and vice versa) but should institute them heirS, exheredation
being allowed only for definite reasons (of which more than a dozen are
specified in the enactment), and the reason in the particular case being
required to be stated in the will. Violation of this new rule entailed
avoidance of the actual institution, the intestate heirs taking the place of
the institutus; in other respects the dispositions of the will were not
affected. It was not necessary that the amount in which an ascendant
or descendant was instituted should be equivalent to his quarta. This
enactment made no change in respect of the reciprocal rights of brother
and sister, but it altogether excluded ascendants and descendants from
the old querella, and limited them to actio ad supplendam legitimam.
