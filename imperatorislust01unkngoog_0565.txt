tentio concessa est, quia ipso iure necessariis sumptibus dos
minuitur, sicut ex latioribus digestorum libris cognoscere liceat.
Sed et si quis cum parente suo patronove agat, item si socius 38

quam adversarius eius facere potest. idem est, si quis ex

defendant was said to have a beneficium competentiae, which was
pleaded in defence. as an excepti0‚ the creditor being bound to spare him
enough of his property to live on, except in actions based on delict and
fraud : ‘in condemnatione personarum, quae in id quod facere possunt
damnantur, non totum quod habent extorquendum est, sed et ipsorum
ratio habenda est, ne egeant’ Dig. 50. 17. 173 ; cf. Dig. 42. 1. 19. 1.
This privilege was accorded by the law on three grounds. On account
of the peculiar personal relation between the parties it belonged to
husband and wife against one another, to parents against children,
patrons against freedmen (§ 38 infi), and to the father-in-law if sued by the
husband for a promised dos durante matrimoni0. By reason of the
nature of the obligation upon which the action was based it was possessed
by the husband and his representatives when sued sor the recovery of a
dos, by socii inter se, and hythe promisor of a gift (ξ 38 infi). On account
of the personal position of the debtor it belonged to the insolvent who
had made a cessio bonorum (ξ 4ο ini), to soldiers against all creditors
whatsoever‚ and to children who had been recently released from patria
potestas in respectos debts contracted while alieni iuriS, unless by the
father-’s death they had come into substantial property. F inally, the
beneficium might be acquired by contract, Dig. 2. 14. 49.

When sued for the recovery of the dos at the termination of the
marriage by the wife, her heim, or the paternal ascendant who had given
it, or during the marriage on account of mismanagement or insolvency,
the husband or his heirs or representatives could deduct impensae
necessariae, by the sum of which the value os the dos was held to have
tacitly (ipso iure) diminished. For impensae utiles as distinct from
necessariae the husband could advance a claim only by actio mandati or
negotiorum gestorum, Cod. 5. 13. 5. The old retentiones propter liberOS,
propter moreS, etc., described by Ulpian, reg. 6. 9-17, were obsolete in
‘the time of justinian.

§ 38. If the societas was omnium bonorum, the partner against whom
the actio pro socio was brought could plead beneficium competentiae as a
matter of right ; if unius rei, the praetor would grant it only after investi-
gation: ‘ quod autem de sociis dictum est, ut et hi in quantum facere

possint condemnentur, causa cognita se facturum praetor edicit ’ Dig. 42.
