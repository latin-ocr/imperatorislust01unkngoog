52 ⁸ INTROD UCTION.

opinion cited by his adversary, and even to involve the judge in
perplexity with an array of responsa and citations os which no single
one agreed precisely with any of the rest. It would seem that
Hadrian expressly extended the usage which was established in
respect of responsa proper to citations from systematic works3 at ·
least such seems the natural inference from Gaius i. 7 ‘ Responsa
prudentium sunt sententiae et opiniones eorum quibus permissum est
jura condere ς quorum omnium si in unum sententiae concurrant, id
quod ita sentiunt legis vicem obtinet ; si vero dissentiunt, iudici· licet
quam velit sententiam sequi, idque rescripto divi Hadriani significatur!
It will be observed that in this explanation of the passage a wide
meaning is given to the expression ‘responsa prudentium,’ which is
taken to mean the juristic writings in general of those ‘quibus per-
missum est iura condere 3' an explanation which seems to be warranted
by Theophilus, who (Paraphr. i. 2. 8), speaking of law made by
the prudentes, SayS, τὸ δὲ παρ’ αὑτῶν νομοθετούμενον γενοκῷ ὀνόματι κέκληται
‘ responsum prudentium,’ and by Papinian's general use of the phrase
‘ auctoritas prudentium' to denote any statements or records from
which the opinions of jurists could be collected, But Savigny
(System i. p. 156) gives responsa here a strictly literal interpretation,
and if his view is right no inference can be drawn from the passage
as to the judicial procedure when the parties to a suit supported their
respective allegations by citing diverse views from the writings of
iuris auctores.

The end of Jurisprudence is in general the same as that of all
science3 a complete grasp‚ a systematic penetration of its subject-
matter3 the power of following the most general propositions into
their minutest ramifications, and inversely of ascending from the most
concrete case, through all intermediate stages of thought, to the prin-
ciple which governs it. This grasp and t'his power belonged in an
admirable degree to the Roman jurists; their highest qualities are
their mastery of their subject, their wonderful capacity os regarding
and deciding every concrete case with reference to some rule, and
their logical subsumption of all their rules under a comparatively
small number of great legal principles. Accordingly, in some re-
spects their legal method left nothing to be desired. But from
another point of view the Roman jurisprudence is more open to
criticism. The cause may be disputed ; it may have been the back·
ward state of general scientific knowledge, or the exclusion of the
jurists from all other departments os politica] lise: but certain it is
that their absorption in their peculiar study blinded them to the fact
