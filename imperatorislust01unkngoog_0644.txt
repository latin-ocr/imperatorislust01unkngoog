true, the implied right is as clearly brought out by the instructions to
the iudex as if express reference had been made to it in the formula.
Actions of this kind—in factum conceptae—form the great illustra-
tion of the praetorian development of Substantive through Adjective
Law. The earliest mode in which the praetor conferred n'ghts un-
known to the ius civile was by the employment of fictions. His
instructions to the iudex might be paraphrased thus: ‘The plaintiff
has, by the civil law, no right whatever against the defendant3 but if,
supposing so and so were the fact, he would be entitled iure civili, then
find for him in any case.’ Sir Henry Maine has shown¹ why this ex-
pedient was at first adopted in preference to openly altering the law.
‘ Fictions satisfy the desire for improvement, which is not quite wanting,
at the same time that they do not offend the superstitious disrelish for
change which is always present. At a particular stage of social pro-
gress they are invaluable expedients for overcoming the rigidity of
law! Eventually, however, the praetor discarded his original method,
and began to boldly grant independent actions in cases which bore no
analogy whatsoever to other relations already protected iure civili. The
Intentio of such new actions could not allege a rtgght in the plaintiff,
forthere was, ex hypothesi, no right by the civil law at all 3 but it could
allege a fact or facts, and the judge could be instrueted to find for or
against the plaintiff according as he ascertained the allegation to be
true or untrue ¹. Actiones in factum conceptae, in short, are not civil
law actions at all: they are all derived from the imperium of the magis-
trate ⁸. The formulae of those which were of most frequent occur-
rence were permanently incorporated in the album3 on these others
were modelled, and thus we get actiones in factum directae, and ac-
tiones in factum utiles. All, however, so far as we know them, are in
personam, forming a third class of personal actionS, co·ordinate with
stricti iuris and bonae fidei iudicia. The two latter are easily dis-
tinguishable from actiones in factum by their having an Intentio in
ius concepta—which contains, i. e. the word ‘ oportere : ' but Savigny
is of opinion that the more equitable rules and free procedure os
bonae fidei actions were applied, so far as was possible, to actiones in
factum as well. Under some circumstances, indeed, a plaintiff might

³ Hence the division of actions into civiles (or legitimae) and honor-ariae (Bk.
iv. 6. 3 supr), the latter being those which were referable solely to the imperium, and

had no foundation in the civil law at a113 they consist of the two classes of actiones
utiles and in factum conceptae.
