sed et maior asperitas dominorum eiusdem principis con-
stitutione coercetur. nam consultus a quibusdam praesidibus
provinciarum de his serviS, qui ad aedem sacram vel ad
statuas principum confugiunt, praecepit ut, si intolerabilis
videatur dominorum saevitia, cogantur servos bonis con-
dicionibus vendere, ut pretium domiuis daretur, et recte:
expedit enim rei publicae, ne quis re sua male utatur. cuius
rescripti ad Aelium Marcianum emissi verba haec sunt: ‘Do-
minorum quidem potestatem in suos servos illibatam esse
oportet nec cuiquam hominum ius suum detrahi. sed domi-
norum interest, ne auxilium contra saevitiam vel famem vel
intolerabilem iniuriam denegetur his qui iuste deprecantur.
ideoque cognosce de querellis eorum, qui ex familia Iulii
Sabini ad statuam confugerunt, et si vel durius habitos, quam
aequum est, vel infami iniuria affectos cognoveris, veniri iube,
ita utin potestatem domini non revertantur. qui Sabinus, si
meae constitutioni fraudem fecerit, sciet me admissum severius
exsecuturum.' ·

DE PATmA POTESTATE.

In potestate nostra sunt liberi nostri, quos ex iustis nuptiis

Tit. ῙΧ. The children born of lawful wedlock between an independent
citizen and a woman with whom he had connubium were born in his
potestas; and unless he died first, or they were voluntat-ily released by
him, they remained under it, with trifling exceptions, to the day of their
death. The peculiarity of this, as compared with other peoples, is
noticed by many writers (Gaius i. 55 ; cf. Sextus Empir. Pyrrhon. iii. 24
οἵ τε Ῥωμαίων νομοθέται τοὺς παῖδας ὑποχειρίους καὶ δούλους· τῶν πατέρων
κελεύουσιν εἶναι . . . παρ’ ἑτέροις δὲ ὡς τυραννικὸν τοῦτο ἐκβέβληται, Servius
ad Verg. Aen. xi. 143 ‘ filii in potestate patris . . . servi loco’). What is
strange about it is not so much its stringency, as its survival, through
centuries of legal history, to the time of Justinian, and its deliberate
perpetuation in his legislation. This is explained in some degree by the
Roman aversion to any change in old established custom which the
advance in social conditions did not render absolutely necessary; still
more by the fact that the patria potestas of the sixth century of our own
era was a very different institution from that of the earlier period3 the
rights of the father over the person os the child had been largely curtailed
by both law and custom, and by the development of the different kinds
of peculium (Bk. ii. 9. 1, and noteS, int), the position of the son in
respect of property and contract had been largely assimilatcd to that os
