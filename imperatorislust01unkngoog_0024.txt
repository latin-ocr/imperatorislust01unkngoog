12 ’ INTRODUCTION.

this anomaly had originally been grounded on political considerationS,
it was now retained for purposes of mere annoyance only ; but the
deliverance os the plebeians was not yet. Even now too they were
still legally incapable of possessing the ager publicus3 and this ap-
peared the more hard, because, on the one hand, their taxation was
out os all proportion to that of the patricianS, while the possession
of the ager publicus was untaxed, and yet, on the other, it was
mainly through their own valour that it had become ager publicus
at all. Some slight compensation was made for this by a lex Cassia
(ac. 486) which effected a distribution os newly-conquered territory,
and placed some restrictions on the patrician enj0yment of the public
land. A third grievance was the unlimited power of the magistrates
to inflict pecuniary fines; this was curtailed by the leges Menenia,
Tarpeia, and Papiria, passed between 460 and 430 nc. Lastly, the
patricians controlled the entire administration of justice3 it was the

, consul who presided over the preliminary stage of every action, and

if he did not decide it out of hand, the judges were most usually
the patrician decemviri, upon whom this sunction had been cast by
Servius Tullius, it was the pontifices themselves, members os the
patrician caste, who interpreted the law, and solved its knotty prob-
lems. Moreover, the very enforcement of the law depended on the
observance of minute forms and technicalities of which, by reason
of their implication with the ius sacrum, the plebeian could know
little or nothing. Some slight amelioration of these hard conditions
must have been afforded by the lex Pinaria ¹, which belongs to this
period, and which, in certain classes of actions (we may suppose, in
particular, actions os debt), allowed the parties to choose a single
judge, to the exclusion of the magistrates' own jurisdiction and of the
decemviral court (Gaius iv. 15). But the class from which the judge
was to be chosen seems to have been limited in some way of which
we have no certain knowledge; and the chief interest of the lex
Pinaria is that it served as a precedent for the principle enunciated
by Cicero (pro Cluentio ·4 3) in the words ⁶ neminem voluerunt
maiores nostri esse iudicem nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset!

In the year ac. 462 the tribune Terentillus had procured a reso·
lution of the plebs, ‘ ut quinque viri creentur legibus de imperio con-
sulari scribendis,' which the senate refused to send on to the comitia
centuriata. Nothing daunted, he proposed, in the next year and in
the same way, a codification of the whole law by decemviri. This

² Its date was, according to Huschke, Β. C. 472 (Versassung des Servius p. 595).
