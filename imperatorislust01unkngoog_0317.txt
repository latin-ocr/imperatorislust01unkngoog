Tit. 23] DE FIDEICOMMISSARIIS HEREDITA TIBUS 30 5

habeat heres ex voluntate testatoris quartam sive plus sive
miuus sive penitus nihil, ut tunc, quando vel nihil vel minus
quarta apud eum remaneat, liceat ei vel quartam vel quod
deest ex nostra auctoritate retinere vel repetere solutum,
quasi ex Trebelliano senatus consulto pro rata portione
actionibus tarn in heredem quam in fideicommissarium com-
petentibus· si vero totam hereditatem sponte restituerit,
omnes hereditariae actiones fideicommissario et adversus eum
competunt. sed etiam id, quod praecipuum Pegasiani senatus
consulti fuerat, ut, quando recusabat heres scriptus sibi datam
hereditatem adire, necessitas ei imponeretur totam heredi-
tatem volenti fideicommissario restituere et omnes ad eum et
contra eum transire actiones, et hoc transponimus ad senatus
consultum Trebellianum, ut ex hoc solo et necessitas heredi
imponatur, si ipso nolente adire fideicommissarius desiderat
restitui sibi hereditatem, nullo nec damno nec commodo

retaining those provisions of the SC. Pegasianum which gave the heir a
right to a fourth of the inheritance clear of fideicommissa, and which
enabled the heres fideicommissarius to compel the direct heir to make
aditio; but repealing that which had suspended the operation of the
SC. Trebellianum where the fideicommissa exceeded in amount three·
fourths of the hereditas· Under his system, whenever a definite fraction
of an inheritance is transferred under a fideicommissum, the transferee is
in loco berediS, and capable of suing and being sued, in the ratio of the
share which comes to him.

The right, which Justinian confers upon the heir, of recovering the
fourth even after he had paid in excess to the fideicommissariuS, was un-
known to the older law : ‘ qui totam hereditatem restituit, cum quartam
retinere ex Pegasiano debuisset, si non retineat, repetere eam non potest,
nec enim indebitum solvisse videtur, quia plenam fidem defuncto prae-
stare maluit’ Paul. sent. ree. 4. 3.4. In Gaius’ time (ii. 283) if one by
mistake paid more than was due under a fideicommissum, the balance
could be recovered : with a legacy it was otherwise.

1t will be remembered that the partiary legatee was only a ‘ singular’
successor: he became liable for the testator’s deth, not ipso iure, in
virtue of the transfer to him of a share of the hereditaS‚ but only by
express agreement (stipulationes partis et pro parte) with the heir. After
Justinian's ‘exaequatio ² of legacies and fideicommissa this ceased to be
sc, and the partiary legatee became a universal successor just like the
heres fideicommissarius. For some illustrations of the joint operation of
the lex Falcidia and the law relating to fideicommissa see Poste’s Gaius,
PP· 292-295·
