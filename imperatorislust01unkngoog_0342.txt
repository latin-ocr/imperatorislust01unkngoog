mere cognateS, in relation to her, to that of sui heredes, th'us giving
them a statutory right of succeeding her to the exclusion of her
agnates.

The intestate succession to freedmen is dealt with in Title 7, the
earlier paragraphs of which give a historical summary of the old
rules in cases of both testacy and intestacy, and of the changes intro- .
duced in the interest of the patron by the Praetor and the lex Papia
Poppaea. Between this, and a brief account of the curiously con-
trasted mode of succession to Latini Iuniani, a class of freedmen
which as we know was abolished by Justinian, is a statement of his
own settlement of the classes entitled to succeed upon the intestacy
· of a civis libertus, and of the latter’s testamentary rights against the
patron. The modification which might conceivably be effected in
these rules by the exercise of a power, conferred by a senatusconsult,
of assigning any particular freedman to any particular child in one’s
power is considered in Title 8.

The Roman law of intestate succession, especially to ingenui, is an
admirable illustration os the heterogeneous mass of rules which may
grow round any subject usually regulated by law where there is a
variety of legislative organS, often actuated by diverse motives, and
little anxiety in the supreme legislature or in the lawyer class to
reduce them to formal order and unity by some process of codifi—
cation. Technically, of course, the rules which, at the date of the
publication of the Institutes, decided on whom an intestate person’s
universitas iuris should devolve, were enacted by Justinian himself ς
historically, they originated either in the Twelve Tables, or in the
Edict relating to bonorum possessio, or in the later civil law, which,
either through senatusconsulta or imperial constitutions conferred
at long intervals of legislation, and in an entirely disconnected
manner, rights of succession upon relatives of the deceased whom
the earlier law had altogether passed over. The main drist of this
series os changes was the same throughout: to fill up the voids
and correct the anomalies of the Twelve Tables; to substitute
cognatiori sor agnation as the sole title a person could have to
succeed. No department of law called more imperatively for a
comprehensive simplification, such, sor instance, as that which we
have seen Justinian effected in the law of Usucapion and Prescription 3
but the changes made in the Corpus Iuris are hesitating and tentative,
the most considerable perhaps being that in the classes of bonorum
possessores, necessitated by Justinian's reform in the succession to
liberti, of which a full account is given in Title 9. When the Insti-
