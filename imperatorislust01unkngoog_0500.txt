488 INTRODUCYION To BOOK IV.

determined by illustrations 3 the necessity of Intent to constitute the
offence is dwelt upon 3 and finally there is an examination of the
question, what interest will suffice to enable a person to bring the
penal action.

Robbery (Title a) implies Theft ; the injured person consequently
may proceed by either actio furti or bonorum vi raptorum, though the
latter, being praetorian, waS, so far as it was penal‚ barred by prescription
in an annus utilis. The distinction between the two offences is that
Robbery is always accompanied by violence; there is also a differenoe
in the nature of the remedy, by which, should the offence be treated
as rapina, both penalty and compensation are simultaneously recovered,
whereas the actio furti is penal only, compensation being obtained by
condictio furtiva. A stringent enactment of Valentinian is here noticed,
which was designed to check violent seizure of property, moveable or
immoveable‚ under the pretence that the seizor believed it to be his
own; a plea which excluded the presumption of dolus malus», and
consequently exempted him from the penalties of both Theft and
Robbery. It is also observed that to enable one to sue on the latter
one's interest in the property may be even more slender than is
required to support an actio furti.

The third Title treats of the lex Aquilia, an early statute which
practically contains the whole of the law of Injury to property, damnum
iniuria datum. The peculiarity of this Delict is that mere negligence
is sufficient to render one liable to its penalties: ‘ non minus quam ex
dolo ex culpa quisque hac lege tenetur.’ What amounts to negligence
in this connection is clearly shown by a series of illustrationS. The
lex Aquilia contained three chapter& the second of which was obsolete
under Justinian. The first dealt with the killing of slaves and certain
domesticated animaIS, and imposed a penalty of the highest value
such slave or animal had borne at any time within the year imme-
diately preceding. The third related to almost every other kind of
damage to property: its penalty was such property’s highest value
within the last thirty days before the wrong was done. Certain exten-
sions of the statute by the ⁴ interpretatio ’ of the older juristS, and
by the action of the praetor, to cases not strictly within its letter are
noticed, and the wide meaning of ‘damnum’ to be gathered from its
terms is illustrated by exampleS.

The fourth Delict (Iniuria, Title 4) is aimed at the honour, good
name, and reputation of a free person: it comprises such acts as
assault and battery, libel, slander, and in fact all treatment of or de-
meanour towards a man by which his character is likely to be injured.
