of being administered by saving from magisterial caprice the decision
of most points upon which the successful conduct of an action de-
pended. The enactment of the Twelve Tables is also direct evi<
dence of the independent position which private law had won for
itself under plebeian auspiceS, and at the same time starts it on a
new career of development; it was no longer the peculiar province
of the plebeian order; but having been sanctioned by the whole
populus in its comitia, it began to be looked on more by all parties
as the best security for order and prosperity. But this is part of a
subject on which there is great diversity of opinion, and to which
we shall shortly return—the relation, at Rome, of private to public
law.

English lawyers in particular will fully appreciate the advantage
which was secured by the expression of the law in a more scientific
and therefore more convenient form than that in which it had hitherto
been clothed. But it was a still larger boon that provision was made
for its being generally known by all citizens who cared to make thern-
selves acquainted with it. Historical analogy would perhaps lead us
to suppose that the knowledge of the law had hitherto been engrossed
by the patrician caste, as represented by the pontifices, who are de-
scribed in a passage os Pomponius already cited (Dig. 1. 2. 2. 6) as
the only masters of the legal rules and forms of procedure at that
time binding. But it has already been suggested that private law
was to a large degree of plebeian creation, and the sole possession os
legal knowledge by a dominant aristocracy is truer of the Greek
oligarchies than of Rome, of which we may, with some qualification,
accept the view of the German historical school of juristS, who assert
that the material law was no secret, being founded on the common
legal consciousness (Rechtsbewusstsein) of the nation as evidenced
and attested by its usages and customs. Stin, it is of no avail to
know the law, if one cannot get one‘s rights protected and enforced
by action; and of the forms of actionS, as already observed‚ the
plebeian could know little, through their implication with the ius
sacrum. The decemviral legislation introduced simplicity and uni-
formity into these3 it was exposed in a public place for all to
read, and from the fact that in Cicero’s boyhood the Roman youth
was used to learn the Twelve Tables by heart, it is evident that they
were long used as the foundation os a legal education as, in the three
centuries and a-half preceding the legislation of Justinian, a mastery
of the Commtaries os Gaius was considered the proper ground-
work of an adequate knowledge of the law. For nearly a thousand
