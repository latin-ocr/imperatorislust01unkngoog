venerit, ut is ex auro suo certi ponderis certaeque formae
anulos ei faceret et acciperet verbi gratia aureos decem,
'utrum emptio et venditio an locatio et conductio contrahi
videatur? Cassius ait materiae quidem emptionem venditio·
nemque contrahi, operae autem locationem et conductionem.
sed placuit tantum emptionem et venditionem contrahi.
quodsi suum aurum Titius dederit mercede pro opera con-
stituta, dubium non est, quin locatio et conductio sit.

5 Conductor omnia secundum legem conductionis facere
debet et, si quid in lege praetermissum suerit, id ex bono
et aequo debet praestare. qui pro usu aut vestimentorum
aut argenti aut iumenti mercedem aut dedit aut promisit, ab

was a lay person, writing was necessary only if and so far as the parties
wished to modify the regulations of the ordinary law as settled by those
two emperors, Cod. 4. 66. 1, N ov. 120. 6. 1.

§ 4. The opinion os Cassius had not many supporters in the time of
GaiuS, who says (iii. 147) ‘plerisque placuit emptionem et venditionem
contrahi.' The true criterion in such cases is given by Javolenus in Dig.
18. 1. 65 ‘toties conductio alicuius rei est, quoties materia, in qua aliquid
praestatur, in eodem statu eiusdem permanet, quoties vero et immutatur,
‘et alienatur, emptio magis quam locatio intellegi debet.' In iii. 146 Gaius
puts the case of one letting out gladiators for the amphitheatre upon
terms that a specified sum should be ,paid for the services of each who
came out of the conflict unhurt, and a much larger one for each who was
killed or disabled ; though it was a moot point, he says the better opinion
was that it was hire so sar a's the first contingency went, and sale so sar
as the last, each gladiator being the subject of a conditional hiring and a
conditional sale, the event determining which of the contracts was to
oust the other.

ᾗ 5. The rights and duties of the parties respectively can most con-
veniently be arranged under the three different forms of the contract.

i. In locatio conductio rerum the locator must allow the conductor to
use and take the fruits of the res locata during the time agreed upon,
unless prevented by impossibility arising from no fault of his own, in
which case he cannot demand the merces (Dig. 19. 2. 9. 3—4; ib. 19. 6),
though, if he has let a res aliena which its owner recovers from the con-
ductor by real action, he is liable to the latter in damageS, whether in
fault or not, Dig. 19. 2. 7-9. The thing again must be let in such a con-
dition that it can be used sor the purpose agreed upon, Dig. ib. 19. 1 3 if
there are defects of which the locator was aware, he is liable in damages,
ib. ; if they were unknown to him the merces will be abated in proportion
to their importance. Burdens imposed by the law on the res locata itself
