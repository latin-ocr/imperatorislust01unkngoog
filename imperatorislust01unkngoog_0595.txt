Tit. 13.] DE EX CEPT IONIBUS. 583

iuvari. Haec exempli causa rettulisse sufficiet. alioquin quam 6
ex multis variisque causis exceptiones necessariae sint, ex
latioribus digestorum seu pandectarum libris intellegi potest.
Quarum quaedam ex legibus vel ex his, quae legis vicem 7
optinent, vel ex ipsius praetoris iurisdictione substantiam

hoc differunt, quod cum eadem res ab eodem mihi debeatur, singulas
obligationes singulae causae sequuntur, nec ulla earum alterius petitione
vitiatur' Dig. ib. 14. 2 5 e. g. ‘si is qui Stichum dari stipulatus fuerat
heres exstiterit ei, cui ex testamento idem Stichus debebatur, si ex testa·
mento Stichum petierit, non consumet stipulationem, et contra si ex
stipulatu Stichum petierit, actionem ex testamento salvam habebit, quia
initio ita constiterint hae duae obligationes, ut altera in iudicium deducta
altera nihilominus integra maneret ’ Dig. 44. 7. 18.

(2) The parties in the second must be the same as in the first action
(‘ inter easdem personas’ Dig. 44. 2. 3). In Justinian's time, however,
this rule had been somewhat modified. A defendant could plead the
exceptio if he had previously been sued on the same ground by an agent
of the present plaintiff : ⁶ hoc iure utimur, ut ex parte actoris in exceptione
rei iudicatae hae personae continerentur, quae rem in iudicium deducant.
Inter hos erunt procurator, cui mandatum est, tutor, curator furiosi vel
pupilli, actor municipum ; ex persona autem rei etiam defensor numera-
bitur, quia adversus defensorem qui agit litem in iudicium deducit’ Dig.
44. 2. 1 1. 7 ; for the earlier law see note on Tit. 10. pr. supr. A party was
also identified with those whom he had succeeded either universally or
singularly, Dig. 44. 2. 9. 2 ; ib. 11. 3, with those who owned jointly with
him land subject or entitled to a praedia] servitude (though only in re-
lation thereto) Dig. 8. 5. 4. 3 and 4, and with his correi, Dig. 12. 2. 28. 3.
Se, t00, if in an action between the testamentary and intestate heirs of a
deceased person the will was declared void or valid, the judgment bound
the legatees and creditorS, Dig. 20. 1. 33 30. 5. 1 3 and, as a rule, all
persons were bound by decisions on questions os status, so that (e. g.) if
A was found to be B's son by a praeiudicium, all persons had to re·
cognise him as the brother of B's other children, whether the finding was
right or not, Dig. 25. 3. 1—3.

ξ ’1. Exceptiones might arise from any os the sources by which rights
in general were conferred, for as a statute, a senatusconsult, or the edict
could create rights, they could also, ex vi termini, create the right to an
exceptio; but in form they may be said to be all praetorian, as it was
the praetor who enabled them to be advanced through the formula, and
in the legis actio period they were unknown, Gaius iv. 108. Among
those based on statutes arethe exceptio legis Cinciae, p. 225 supr„ fragm.
Vat. 310, legis Plaetoriae, and legis Iuliae (de bonorum cessione); on
senatusconsulta the exceptiones SC¹. Trebelliani, Dig. 15. 2. 1. 83 SCi.
Macedoniani, and sci. Velleiani ; on imperial enactment, the exceptio by
which under the epistola Hadriani the fideiussor claimed the beneficium
