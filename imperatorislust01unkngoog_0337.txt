POSSESSION. 325

Possession through the other, though this intention will be implied
where that other is his own slave acquiring ex peculiari causa, a
guardian, curator, or the agent of a juristic person.

(3) There must be a certain legal relation between principal and
agent. Possession can be acquired through slaves by the dominus
(provided he possesses the slave), the bona fide possessor, and the
usufructuary; through filiifamilias by the pater (for persons in manu
or mancipio see Gaius ii. 90) ; through guardians or curators by the
ward, and through free agents by any principa] who has previously
given them a commission, or who has subsequently ratified their acts
(Dig. 4¹· 2. 1. 203 ib. 9. 34. 2). Where the agent already has
possession of the object prior to his commission‚ the mere subsequent
exercise of will turns his possession into detention; the possession
vests immediately in the principal. This, which is the converse os
traditio brevi manu, is called constitutum possessorium.

Possession already acquired is retained by the continuing presence
of its two elements; but the law does not require for its retention
so much ‘energy’ (so to speak) on either side as sor its original
acquisition: see Poste, Gaius pp. 646-7. The question how pos-
session is retained is practically equivalent to that how it is lost ς and
it is lost by the cessation of either corpus or animus domini: ‘ quem-
admodum nulla possessio adquiri nisi animo et corpore potest, ita
nulla amittitur nisi in qua utrumque (i. e. aut utrumque aut alter-
utrum, Sav. Possession ξ 30) in contrarium actum est’ Dig. 41. 2. 8.
Corpus ceases so soon as the possessor loses his ability os dealing
with the thing himself, and of preventing others from dealing with it;
this may occur by its destruction, by his altogether forgetting where
it is, or losing it from beyond his reach (except in the case of a run-
away slave, who is possessed till some one else possesses him, or unless
he bona fide believes himself free, Dig. 41. 2. 13. pr.) ; by its being
stolen, or being taken in possession under a magisterial decree3 by
the possessor’s being taken captive, or by ‘the thing itself ceasing
to be in commercia In order to lose Possession animo solely,
more is required than a mere cessation of the previous mental atti-
tude; there must be a new determination os the will, an animus in
contrarium actus, a deliberate desire to transfer or abandon possession.
Consequently, persons of weak or unsound mind and pupils cannot
lose Possession animo solo. In many cases of course Possession is
lost animo et corpore simul; viz. in abandonment, conveyance, manu·
mission of slaves, and violent ejectment from land on which the

rejected person sears to reenter.
