sionis temporis lege definiti ’ Dig 41. 3. 2 3 it was as old as the Twelve
Tables, in which it is called ususauctoritas. For its operation the
following conditions were required to be satisfied :—

(1) Usucapio‚ being a mode of acquiring dominium ex iure Quiritium,
presupposes (a) that the person acquiring has the commercium: by
this peregrini were excluded: ‘adversus hostem aeterna auctoritas ' (b)
that the thing, which is to be acquired, is not only capable os being
possessed, but is in commercio. This excludes free men (Gaius ii. 48),
res divini iuris (ib.) and res publicae, in particular solum provinciale
(ib. 46)3 the last, however, could be possessed (Savigny, Poss. ξ 9). In
addition to this, certain things were prohibited by positive enactment
from being acquired in this way, especially res furtivae and vi possessae
(§ 2 inf), res mancipi of women in agnatic guardianship, unless delivered
by the woman herself with the guardian’s auctoritas (Gaius ii. 47) 3 res
fiscales (ξ 14 inf.); property of the emperor (eod. 7. 38), and of minors
(Cod. 7. 35. 3) 3 res dotales under certain circumstances, and immoveable
property of religious and charitable corporationS.

(2) The object must be ‘ possessed,’ not merely detained, during the
period required by law, and

(3) The possession must have originated in a iusta causa or a iustus
titulus (⁴ usucapio, non praecedente vero titulo, procedere non potest, nec
prodesse neque tenenti neque heredi eius potest ’ Cod. 7. 29. 43 cs. the
opening section of this Title)‚ and have been accompanied at its incep-
tion by bona fides (ἕξ ι and 3 inf). Both of these expressions need a
little elucidation. By the requirement of iusta causa is meant that the
possessor must have got possession in some way which would have
made him owner, only that in the particular case, owing to some ex-
ternal defect, acquisition of possession is not equivalent to acquisition of
ownership 3 Justinian's language in the first lines of the text is mis-
leading, as the chief use of usucapio was in cases where res mancipi
were transferred by mere traditio (Gaius ii. 41), p. 187 supr. Such
causae os course are numerous, the clue to them in the authorities being
the word ‘ pro ’ (possidet pro solut0, pro empt0, pro herede, pro donato,
pro derelicto, pro legato, pro dote, etc.). By bona fides is meant a
negative rather than a positive state of mind, i. e. ignorance‚ occasioned
by excusable error, of the circumstances which prevent the acquisition
of ownership (‘ qui ignorabat . . . alienum . . . bonae fidei possessor’ Dig.
48. 15. 3. pr.) 3 the cases in which its presence can be really a question
are cases of materially defective acquisition, where the usucapio has to
prevail against an actual (and not merely Quiritarian) owner, as e. g. if a
