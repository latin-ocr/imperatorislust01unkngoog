in the necessity of performing some act within a prescribed time, by
the non-performance of which a right might be lost, and which might
be interfered with either (1) by the courts being closed; (2) by the
absence of some person whose presence was essential, Dig. 44. 3. 1 3
(3) by some disability of the person by whom the act had to be per-
formed, e. g. absence, illness, or excusable ignorance of his right. As a
rule, time was reckoned as continuum; it is usually utile when the
interval for performance is not more than a year and is prescribed by law,
and where the act itself is a judicial one.

Before finally leaving the subject of intestate succession it is necessary
to notice briefly the important revolution which Justinian effected in its
rules by N ov. 118, Α. D. 543. By this he repealed all existing law on the
subject : ‘ prioribus legibus pro hac causa positis cessantibus„ de cetero ea
sola servarique nunc constituimus! The new system was based solely
, on cognation, between which and agnation it disowned any distinction,
save so far as was involved in the recognition of adoptive relationship z
it also treated males and females on precisely the same footing. Intes-
tate successors were arranged in four classeS, in the following order of
priority:

(1) Descendants, division between these being in stirpes: ‘tantam
de hereditate morientis accipientes partem, quanticunque sint, quantam
eorum parem, si viveret, habuisset, quam successionem in stirpes vocavit
antiquitas' N ov. 118. 1: thus a descendant related to the deceased
through both parents received a double portion. The descendant did
not, however, in every case inherit the usufruct along with the proprietas3
e. g. if the deceased was in potestas, note on Tit. 1. 15 supr. ; or if the
deceased was a woman, the surviving husband was entitled to the usu·
fruct osa part, Cod. 6. 60. 3.

(2) AscendantS‚ brothers and sisters of the whole blood, and descendants
in the first degree only of such brothers and sisters deceased. A nearer
was preferred to a remoter ascendant; if there were two or more ascend·
ants in the same degree, they divided the succession per capita if they

belonged to the same line (paternal or maternal); if to different lineS, ¹

each line took half (Nov. 118. 2). Brothers and sisters divided per
capita: if there were also children of a deceased brother or sister, they
took together the share which would have gone to their parent (ib. 3).
1f there were both ascendants and brothers or sisters, or children of a
deceased brother or sister, the division was in capita, the children, how-
ever, taking only one portion together.

(3) Brothers and sisters of the half blood, and descendants in the first
degree of such brothers and sisters deceased.

(4) All other cognate5‚ according to proximity, whether related by the
whole or half blood: ‘si vero neque fratres neque filios fratrum, sicut
diximuS, defunctus reliquerit, omnes a latere cognatos ad hereditatem
vocamus, secundum uniuscuiusque graduspraerogativam, ut viciniores
