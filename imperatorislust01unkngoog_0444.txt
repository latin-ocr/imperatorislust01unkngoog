communicare: si quid vero aliud lucrifaceret, quod non cap-
taverit, ad ipsum solum pertinet: ei vere, cui renuntiatum est,
quidquid omnino post renuntiatam societatem adquiritur, soli
5 conceditur. Solvitur adhuc societas etiam morte socii, quia
qui societatem contrahit certam personam sibi eligit. sed
et si consensu plurium societas coita sit, morte unius socii
solvitur, etsi plures supersint, nisi si in coeunda societate
6 aliter convenerit. Item si alicuius rei contracta societas sit

stated ; a partner who withdrew at a time, or in a manner which would
prejudice the interests of the societaS‚ could be compelled to compensate
his socii, Dig. 17. 2. 143 ib. 17. 23 and if his object was ‘ut obveniens
aliquod lucrum solus habeat,’ and the expected gain turned out a loss, he
had to bear it alone : ‘ Cassius scripsit eum, qui renunciaverit societati, a
se quidem liberare socios suos, se autem ab illis non liberare: quod
utique observandum est, si dolo malo renunciatio facta sit, veluti si, cum
omnium bonorum societatem inissemuS, deinde cum obvenisset uni
hereditas, propter hoc renunciavit ; ideoque si quidem damnum attulerit
hereditas, hoc ad eum qui renunciavit pertinebit, commodum autem com-
municare cogetur actione pro socio’ Dig. 17. 2. 65. 3. So too if one of
two partners renounced while the other was away, the societas was held
to be subsisting as regards the dutieS, but not the rights of the former
until the other had received notice of the withdrawal‚ ib. 4.

65. An agreement that one’s heir should succeed one as partner
(except in societas vectigalis) was void: ‘adeo morte socii solvitur
societas, ut nec ab initio pacisci possimus ut heres etiam succedat
societati' Dig. 17. 2. 59. pr„ ib. 35 ; but the heir, though not a partner,
was bound to complete all business commenced by the deceased, being
herein answerable for culpa lata only, Dig. ib. 35. 36. 40. The death oi
one socius dissolved the contractual relation even between the rest,
unless it had been otherwise agreed at the outset, ib. 65. 9; but in no
case had it any operation until the other partners had heard of the
decease, and transactions entered into by them between the death and
notice of it were transactions of the firm, ib. 65. ιο.

The two higher kinds of capitis deminutio had the same effect on
societas as death ι ‘dicitur et capitis deminutione solvi societatem, quia
civili ratione capitis deminutio morti aequiparari dicitur: sed si adhuc
consentiant in societatem, nova videtur incipere societas’ Gaius iii. 153,
‘societas quemadmodum ad heredes socii non transit, ita nec ad ad·
rogatorem, ne alioquin invitus quis socius efficiatur cui non velit: ipse
autem adrogatus socius permanet, nam etsi filiusfamilias emancipatus
fuerit, permanebit socius’ Dig. 17. 2. 65. 11.

ὁ 6. 50 too a societas was dissolved by the object for which it was
formed proving unattainable, Dig. ib. 58. pr.

67. A forfeiture (publicatio) might be partial only: ‘de vi privata
