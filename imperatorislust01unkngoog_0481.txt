EXCURSUS VI.

DOLUS, CULPA, AND CASUS.

A marr to a contract or quasi-contract may commit a breach of
its terrns, express or implied, either intentionally or unintentionally.
Deliberate breach (dolus) always entailed liability-dolus semper
praestatur—which could not be evaded even by an explicit agreement
to the contrary: ‘ Celsus putat non valere, si convenerit, ne dolus
praestetur: hoc enirn bonae fidei iudicio contrarium est: et ita utimur’
Dig. 50. 17. 23: cf. Dig. a. 14. 27. 3. Certain unintentional breaches
were treated in the same manner, whether consisting in acts of com-
mission or of omission: viz. those which arose from want of ordinary
care, frorn a carelessness so excessive that no ordinary man would
have been guilty of it: this is called culpa lata, and for it, even in
contractual and quasi-contractual relationS, one is always answerable
no less than for doluS‚ or deliberate and intentional breach: ‘lata
culpa est nimia negligentia, id est, non intellegere quod omnes intelle-
gunt' Dig. 50. 16. 213. 2: ib. 223. pr„ ‘lata culpa plane dolo com-
parabitur' Dig. 11. 6. 1. 1, ‘ prope dolum est' Dig. 17. 1. 29. pr.,
‘dolum repraesentat' Dig. 47. 4. 1. 2, ‘dolus est' Dig. 50. 16. 226:
16. 3. 31. Ι

But if a man's negligence or culpa is not of this extreme degree,
the question whether he is answerable for it is deterrnined by reference
to two standards or criteria of carefulneSS, the one abstract or abso-
lute, the other relative or concrete.

(1) In some relations a man is required to show what the Romans
call exacta diligentia, or the diligentia of a bonus paterfamilia3‚ a care·
ful, accurate, sound man of business3 here he is answerable for all
culpa, provided it could have been avoided by one more careful than
himself : ‘ culpa autem abest si omnia facta sunt quae diligentissimus
quisque observaturus fuisset’ Dig. 19. 2. 2 57. Modem writers call
this culpa levis in abstracto: in the authorities it is usually called
culpa simply: when it is said that a man is answerable not only for
dolus but for culpa as well, what is rneant is that he is answerable for

-levis culpa: the liability sor lata culpa, being universal, is implied.
