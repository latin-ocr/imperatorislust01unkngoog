missa tripli condemnatione, sicut supra diximuS, puniatur.

whether in integrum restitutio propter dolum and metum was older
than these remedies, and was to a great extent superseded by them,
as Savigny contendS, is uncertain 3 at any rate it seems clear from Cic.
de off. 3. 14 that restitutio doli causa was unknown before the time of
Gallus Aquilius. 1t is, however, certain that their concurrent existence
narrowed the operation of the equitable relies on these two causae.

An instance of restitutio propter errorem is supplied in the text above ;
the other cases of its application suggest the conclusion that it was
almost entirely confined to laesiones incur-red in the progress of an
action, though examples of its occurrence in substantive law are found in
Dig. 42. 6. 1. 17 ; 34. 9. 17.

Restitutio propter capitis deminutionem occurred only where the
capitis deminutio was minima: ‘pertinet hoc edictum ad eas capitis
deminutiones, quae salva civitate contingunt ς ceterum sive amissione
civitatis, sive libertatis amissione contingat capitis deminutio, cessabit
edictum' Dig. 4. 5. 2. pr. For its application see Bk. iii. 10. 3 and notes
supr.

Persons who, while absent either rei publicae causa, or by reason of
justifiable sear, or in captivity with a public enemy, lost rights of
property or of action could obtain restitution3 and persons at home
could get themselves restituti against others who had obtained a pro-
prietary advantage (e. g. by usucapio, § 5 supr.) or release from an action
while abroad or imprisoned.

The edict upon this subject terminated with the so-called generalis
clausula ε ‘item si qua alia causa videbitur, in integrum restituam ' Dig.
4. 6. 11 ; ib. 26. 9 3 words apparently intended to include all cases, other
than those already specified, in which the realization of a right was
prevented by obstacles of fact rather than oc law.

(3) As a general mle, the case must be one in which the ordinary law
affords no relies τ ‘in causae cognitione etiam hoc versabitur, num forte
alia actio possit competere citra in integrum restitutio ς nam si communi
auxilio et mero iure munitus sit, non debet ei tribui extraordinarium
auxilium ’ Dig. 4. 4. 16. pr. But occasionally restitutio was merely an
alternative, e. g. to the actio doli, quod metus causa, tutelae (Dig. 4. 4. 47.
1), and the bonae fidei actions, Cod. 2. 54. 3; 4. 44. 5; ib. 10. Tbere
are also a number os other exceptione to its general application ς e. g. no
one could claim restitutio against penal laws, against a patron or ascend-
ant, or against his own dolus.

(4) Restitutio must be applied for within a period of prescriptlon fixed
originally at an annus utilis, and extended by Justinian to a quadriennium
continuum (note on § ς supr.). lt is disputed from what moment prescrip·
tion began to run: according to some this is (except in absentia and
minor aetas) the date of laesio ; according to others, the termination of
the causa.

The procedure in the formulary period was extra ordinem. The
