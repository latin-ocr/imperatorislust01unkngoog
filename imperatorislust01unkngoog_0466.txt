plius eae obligationes», quae consensu contrahuntur, contraria

or other not enforceable by action. But two obligations are essential ;
if there is not one to novate, the attempted novation is null ; is there is
one to novate, but the novating contract is void (e. g. ‘ si id quod tu mihi
debeas, a peregrino, cum quo sponsus communio non est, spondes verbo
stipulatus sim ³ Gaius iii. 179), the former is altogether unaffected.

The promise of a slave ordinarily created a natural obligation‚ and
consequently, as Servius Sulpicius argued (Gaius, loc. cit.)‚ it is hard to
see why it should have no novative effect3 the explanation given by
Theophilus is ὅτι ποιεῖ refiert-imm οὗ μόνον τὸ τίκτεσθαι φυσικὴν ἐνοχὴν, ἀλλὰ
καὶ τὸ ὑπεῖναι πρόσωπον· ἇπρόσωποι· δὲ ὀ δοῦλος.

The rule that, is the parties to the new contract are the same, a
novation ensues only if it contains ‘ novi quid,’ holds only where the
· novated obligation was itself verbal. 1f it had been otherwise, novation
would have been disabled from discharging one of its most valued
functions, viz. the substitution of obligations pursued by actions stricti
iuris for obligations ensorceable only by actio ex fide bona. The Procu-
lians were of opinion that the adiectio or detractio of a surety in the new
contract was not sufficient to support a novation, Gaius iii. 178.

For condicio and dies see on Tit. 15. 2 and 4 supr.

Servius Sulpicius had held that a conditional stipulation novated an
unconditional contract whether the condition was fulfined or not. Gaius
(iii. 179) thought that the old contract subsisted until the condition os the
new one was sulfilled, but suggests that if the creditor sued upon it before
such fulfilment he might be met by exceptio doli or pacti, and this was
soon recognised as law, Dig. 23. 3. 503 ib. 833 12. 1. 36 ς though Labeo
(Dig. 2 3. 3. 80) had thought otherwise.

Among the praesumptiones or evidence upon which the jurists relied
to prove that there was animus novandi was, according to the Sabinian
school, the addition of a surety (cf. Dig. 2. 14. 30. 1) 3 for the presumptions
against such intention see Dig. 46. 2. 6. pr. and 1. 3 45. 1. 58. Justinian's
own enactment is in Cod. 8. 42. 8 ; his statement that, unless the inten-
tion to novate was express (‘nisi ipsi specialiter remiserint quidem priorem
obligationem et hoc expresserint, quod secundam magis pro anterioribus
elegerint ’ Cod. loc cit.)‚ the two obligations should subsist side by side is
apparently subject to the qualification that when one was fulfined the
other was ipso sacto extinguished ; see Dig. 46. 2. 8. 5.

ξ 4. When the res was no longer integra, an agreement between the
parties to be off their bargain did not merely extinguish the obligation ε
it rather operated as a new contract which bound the one in whose
favour performance had taken place to restore the other in statum que,
