in favour of detennining it in each individual by reference to actual
physical maturity‚ the Proculians os fixing fourteen years as the age in all
cases: Javolenus Priscus inclined to combine both requirementS, Ulpian,

§L The release osa pupillus from guardianship on being deportatus
might be taken to support the theory that tutela was iuris civilis ; see '

exceptis his quae in iure alieno personis positis deferuntur! Literally,
these words would seem to mean that the tutela exercised by a filius-
familias (under a testament or magisterial appointment) was extinguished
by cap. dim. minima: but this is contradicted by Dig. 27. 3. 11, which
expressly says that emancipation did not have this effect. Consequently,
