INTRODUCTION TO BOOK JV. 493

first deducting from it debts owed to himself in full. There is also a
discussion of the relative advantages to the creditor of these different
actions and of a condictio, where he has an option3 and in ξ 7 we
have a notice of the SC. Macedonianum, which refused an action

upon money loans given to a child in power against the latter himself
no less than against the paterfamilias·

In the following Title (8) there is a corresponding treatment of the
dominus' and paterfamilias’ liability on the delicts of those in their
potestas. The law by which the several delicts had been constituted,
whether civil or praetorian, had given the superior the option of pay-
ing damages or surrendering the delinquent, as a slave or in mancipi0,
to the injured person. Justinian definitely confirmed as law the usage
which had grown up under the later Empire, and which limited this
‘ noxal ' surrender to slaves : children in power were to be personally
liable on their delictS, and the paterfamilias free. The maxim ‘ nox-
alis actio caput sequitur’ is explained in ξ 5, and in ξ 6 there is a
discussion of the effects of delicts committed by slaves against their
own masters. The application of noxal surrender in the case of
pauperieS‚ or damage done by certain domesticated animals, is treated
in Title 9, which also gives some account of a penal action introduced
by the aedile for the redi-ess of injuries or damage done by wild
animals kept under insufficient control near places of public resort.

The Titles between the 9th and the 15th have a nearer relation
to Procedure proper than the other parts of this Book, and are all
closely modelled after Gaius. The first of them deals‚ though some-
what uninstructively‚ with the employment of agents or attorneys in
litigation, which, originally tolerated only in very few caseS, had, as
Justinian remarkS, become almost universally permissible under the
later practice. T itle 1 1 gives a historical account of the earlier law
as to the security to be given by plaintiffs and defendantS‚ especially
when represented by such attorneyS, and then proceeds to state the
rules in force upon this subject under Justinian, and Title 12 discusses
the active and passive transmission of rights of action, their extinction
by a longer or shorter prescription‚ and the right of a defendant under
the maxim ‘ omnia iudicia absolutoria' to be acquitted if he satisfied
the plaintiff's claim at any moment before judgment.

Exceptiones—a class of defences consisting in the plea of a counter-
vailing right as distinct from a direct denial of the plaintifl's allega-
tions-—l'orm the subject of Title 13, and are copiously illustrated in
its first few paragraphs. The most important classification of them,
which turns upon the energy of their operation in respect of time and
