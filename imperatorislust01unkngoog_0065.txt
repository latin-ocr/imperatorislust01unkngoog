THE ROMAN JURJSTS ΛΝΒ LEGAL EDUCAYJON. 53

that law is but one of the agencies by which the life of a nation is
developed‚ and that it stands in close relation to other influences all
os which must play their part in duly promoting the welfare of the
social organism. These other influences-literature, what are now
called the moral or social sciences, art, and, we may perhaps add,
religion-*they left more or less out of sight, or at any rate failed to
see the inevitable correlation between them and their own favourite
subject, to appreciate the function of philosophy as the common
element in, the connecting link between, the various branches of
human thought. As the queen of the sciences, philosophy watches
over the element which they share each with one another, by keeping
them before her in orderly review, by restraining each within its due
‘sphere‚ by maintaining them in their proper relation, she discharges
her function os giving to each its perfect form, its true development.
This relation between philosophy and the sciences was not ade-
qnately perceived by the Roman jurists‚ because its true appre-
ciation depends on conditions many of which are realised only in
the modern world. To them iurisprudence was philosophy and all
philosophy. Ulpian says, ‘iustitiam colimus, et boni et aequi noti·
tiam profitemur; aequum ab iniquo separantes, licitum ab illicito dis-
cernenteS, bonos non solum metu poenarum, verum etiarn praemiorum
quoque exhortatione efficere cupienteS, veram nisi fallor philosophiam,
non simulatam affectantes? The words are those of a moralist‚ not of
a lawyer; and the failure to distinguish sufficiently between jurispru-
dence and the other scienceS, notably ethics‚ resulted in logical faults,
especially of definitiom which mar to no small degree the excellences
by which the Roman law is on other grounds distinguished ¹.

The mode in which the earlier prudentes acquired their know-
ledge of law has been already noticed. After a short preliminary
instruction in the leading terms and distinctions of jurisprudence‚
which was denoted by the term ⁶ instituere,' their training was purely
practical, and consisted in attending a leading lawyer in court and
chambers, and in thus picking up both learning and the modes of
applying it. No jurist refused the youth of Rome the privilege of
thus attaching themselves to him as auditores, in order under his

auspices to learn the law ; indeed it was considered an honourable ·

distinction. ‘ Ius civile docere,' says Cicero, ‘ semper pulcrum fuit,
hominumque clarissimorum discipulis floruerunt domus ;’ and of
