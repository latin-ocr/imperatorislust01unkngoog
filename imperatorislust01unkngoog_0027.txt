RELATION OF PUBLIC' AND PRIVATE LAW. 15

years they remained the only complete legislation which professed to
embrace the whole positive law of Rome, and though in point os
fact the greater part of their original substance was repealed or .
modified by subsequent enactrnent3‚ the Roman citizen, even under
the Empire‚ always continued to revere them as the solid basis of the
noble system of jurisprudence by which all his rights and duties were
determined; and it was only by the great work of Justinian that,
nine hundred and eighty-four years after their enactment‚ they were
formally deprived of their authority.

At this point it will be well to pause in order to look back over the
centuries behind us and try to ascertain what was the material con-
tent and what the scope of the customary law which, as we have
seen, was to the early Romans the only rule of life, and which was
summed up and (if we may use the expression) codified in the

Twelve Tables. Ausonius (Idyll xi. 61) describes the contents os
the latter as ‘ ius triplex: ’

‘Sacrurm privatum, populi commune quod usquam est?

But there is little to be said on this particular point except what can
be inferred from the fragments which have been preserved to us.
These relate to the procedure in an action, especially summons
(Table i), execution (iii), mancipation (vi) and emancipation (iv),
succession (v), curatela of furiosi (vi), furtum, iniuria, and other
forms of delict (viii), and finally burial of the dead (x). As might
perhaps have been expected, the only really important department oi
the private code upon which, so far as we know, the Twelve Tables
contained no provisions, is contract.

Legal antiquaries on the continent who have accepted as sub-
stantially true the myth which ascribes the origin of Rome to the
union of three tribes belonging to different ethnic stocks, two of
which are by them identified as Pelasgic and Sabine ¹, have spent
much ingenuity in attempting to detect the original diversity of the
elements contributed to the common stock of jurisprudence by the
two dominant tribes, and to trace the gradual process by which these
were blended into a homogeneous system of law. They speak of
the element peculiar to the RamneS, as opposed to that peculiar to
the Quirites; the genius os the former people lay in the direction of
conquest and activity in external,relations, that of the latter in the
promotion of domestic order and peacesul internal development3 and
