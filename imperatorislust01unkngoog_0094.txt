82 INTRODUCTION To BOOK I.

sensu stricto (Title ιι), and (3), legitimation (Title ro, ξ 13). Corres-
ponding to these are described the modes in which patria potestas
may be dissolved, and a person alieni may become sui iuris (Title 1 2),
most of which may be grouped together under the three kin-ds of
capitis deminuti0‚ which is described in Title 16, rather out of its
proper place. The guidance and control which children require in
their tender years is naturally provided by the care of the father 3 but
to meet the contingency of the latter's death while a child is still
impubeS, and especially to protect his proprietary interestS, the Roman
law established various forms os guardianship, to which the reader is
introduced by a further distinction of persons sui iuris. into those who
have a tutor or curator, and those who act entirely for themselves
(Title 13). The various forms of guardianship are treated in the

succeeding titles, and the functions of a guardian, together with the .

limits of their necessary exercise‚ are touched on in Title 21. Title 22
relates to the modes in which guardianship is terminated, and Title 2 3
to cumton, or persons appointed by the magistrate to manage the
property os various classes of persons—minors over the age of puberty,
lunatim, interdicted prodigals, and others wh0, from some mental
or bodily infirmity, are incapable of adequately attending to their
own affairs. T itle 24 describes the circumstances under which·
guardians and curators have to give security for the due administration
of their office, the nature of such security‚ and the liability of magis-
trates who neglect to exact it when they appoint these functionaries.
Lastly, in Title 25, it is pointed out that the duties of guardians and
curators are of a public nature, and cannot, as a general rule, be
declined by any· one called upon to undertake them; certain grounds
of excuse however were recognised by law, and these are enumerated
in detail.

The very exhaustive treatment which the status familiae, as con-
trasted with libertas and civitas, obtains in Gaius and the Institutes
of Justinian has led Savigny to regard the ‘ius quod ad personas
pertinet' as merely family law, and to maintain that such was the
meaning which those writers themselves.attributed to it. He examines
the view that the real subject of their first book is status, though
not exactly in the sense in which we have understood the term3
that is to say, he distinguishes status into natural and civil; by the
latter he means the three great status to which alone we have given
our attention; by the former he would express the differences which
exist among persons as subJects of rights and duties on account of
differences of age, sex, health‚ etc. This, of course, is a perversion
