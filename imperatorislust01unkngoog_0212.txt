200 INSTJTUTJONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [nb. n.

et tributaria praedia eodem modo alienantur. vocantur autem

without any prescribed form, which aster Justinian's abolition of the dis-
tinction between Quiritarian and bonitarian ownership- remained the
universal mode of conveying property in res corporales. No mere mental
act was sufficient for this purpose: there must be corporeal delivery:
‘traditionibus et usucapionibus dominia rerum, non nudis pactis trans-
feruntur² Cod. 2. 3. 30. The only exception to this mle in Roman law
is societas omnium bonorum (for which see on Bk. iii. 25. pr. inf.), though
iura in re aliena could be created by bare agreement, as in hypotheca,
and perhaps in servitudes generally, see on Tit. 3. 4 inf. Traditio, how·
ever, by itself transferred only possession3 the dominium of an object
passed only if the transferor was owner (for which see int), and the
delivery was accompanied by a iusta causa traditionis, i. e. the intention
on the one hand to give, on the other to receive ownership: ‘nunquam
nuda traditio transfert dominium, sed ita, si venditio vel aliqua iusta
causa praecesserit, propter quam traditio sequeretur' Dig. 41. 1. 31.
Among such causae, besides venditio, (105, and donatio, which are men-
tioned in the text, may be enumerated solutio (payment), mutuum (loan),
and permutatio (exchange). Though the causa usually existed con-
temporaneously with the delivery, it might arise subsequently, as in the
cases mentioned in ὁ 44 inf., in which the result of the traditio by itself
was either mere detention (as in deposit)‚ or civil possession (as in
pignus and precarium), the causa superveniens converted this into
dominium. Provided there was a sufficient causa, a mistake of the
parties as to the real nature of the transaction did not prevent the
property from passing: thus if A thinks he is paying B a debt, while
the latter thinks he is making him a present, the property passes to B,
and he becomes owner of the res tradita, for this was intended by both,
though the transaction is neither gift nor payment, Dig. 41. 1. 36.

According to the general rule that no one can give a better title than
he has himself, the owner alone could usually transfer dominium : ⁸ tra-
ditio nihil amplius transferre debet, vel potest, ad eum qui accepit, quam
est apud eum qui tradit: si igitur quis dominium in fundo habuit, id
tradendo transfert, si non habuit, ad eum, qui accipit, nihil transfert ’
Dig. 41. 1. 20. pr. Some apparent exceptions to this {are-,explained by
the transferor’s being actually (§ 42 inf.) or constructively :the owner's
agent (e. g. his tutor, curator, or pledgee) 3 a real exception is found in
the sale of res alienae by the fiscus (Tit. 6. 14 inf.), and possibly in
Cod. 1. 2. 2 3. 1. In some cases even the owner could not convey, either
because he was incapable ofperforming legal acts (H andlungsunfa'higkeit),
or because he was by law prohibited from the management of his own
property (e. g. prodigi), or because his alienation was nullified by positive
enactment, Tit. 8 inf.
