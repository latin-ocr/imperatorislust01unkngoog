PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LA W. 17

captured booty belonged, primarily, to the state, and that it was
through the state alone that it could become the property of indi-
viduals. Thus, according to the view now under consideration, no
citizen originally owned an inch of Roman soil; he could only
possess and enjoy it by permission of the populus, and it remained
ager publicus until the settlement of large numbers of strangers on
Roman territory had brought into prominence the legal distinction
between civis and peregrinuS, a distinction which then became em-
phasised by the former being held capable, the latter incapable, of
owning land ex iure Quiritium. But to maintain the principle that au
res mobiles belonged, ultimately, to the state, was less easy. On one
explanation, however, of a famous distinction of Roman law—that of
‘res mancipi' and ‘res nec mancipi’—the traces of that principle were
retained until the distinction itself was swept away by Justinian. It
is suggested that the idea that all res mobiles belong ultimately to the
state survived only in connection with certain subjects of property—
things, in other words, which usually form the staple of military booty‚
and of which individuals were thus most likely to have got possession
by concession from the state. This idea, it is maintained, led to the
introduction of a peculiar mode of alienation for these kinds of ob-
jectS, namely, mancipatio, in which the sanction of the populus to the
transaction was supplied by the presence of a definite number of
witnesses who were full citizens of Rome (Gaius i. u 9) ¹. But what-
ever may be the truth as to the distinction of res mancipi and res nec

¹ This is but one of many views as to the origin of the distinction. Sir Henry
Maine (Andeut Law p. 27 5) says: ⁸ The explanation which appears to cover the
greatest number of instances is, that the objeets of enjoyment honoured above the
rest were the forms of property known first and earliest to each particular com·
munsty. and dignified therefore emphatically with the designation os Pr0pcrty.
On the other hand. the articles not enumerated among the favoured objects seem
to have been placed on a lower standing. because the knowledge of their value
was posterior to the epoch at which the catalogue of superior property was settled.
They were at first unknown, rare, limited in their uses, or else regarded as
mere appendages to the privileged objeets. Thus, though the Roman res mancipi
included a number os moveable articles of great value, stin the most costly jewels
were never allowed to take rank as res mancipi, because they were unknown to
the early Romans.’ lhering thinks that the res mancipi were those objects of
property essential to the maintenance of the joint family life: ⁸ ohne beides [i. e.
free persons and res mancipi] lasst :es sich ein ordentliches Hauswesen, eine
gesunde Wirthschast gar nicht denken' (Geist des r6misehen Rechts ii. p. 165).
Other explanations are based on the actual market value (Kostbarkeit) of the
objects (Cujaciusa Bynkershoek), or on the supposition that a special return of res
mancipi was required in the census (Puii'endorf, Gottling). The matter is fully
discnssed, aud the divergent views stated, in BQ, Institutionen 5 73·
