EARLIER HIS T ΟΕ Υ OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 617

' covered by the plaintiff in a Roman action on delict attest the nature
of the practice, though in them the ‘ penalty’ is usually fixed by the
state, and not by the parties ¹. This less barbarous method of settling
disputes and claims is familias to every one who has any acquaintance
with the law os the Germanic tribes. Mr. Kemble observes ² that under
Anglo-Saxon law there was hardly any wrong a man could suffer which
could not be atoned for by a money payment. At Rome, so sar as
we can judge, it was confined to·delict; ’for breach of contract the
ultimate remedy, even in historical times, remained the right of arrest
and detention3 the debtor who could not, or would not, discharge his
obligations fell a victim to the severe process of manus iniectio; he
was sold into foreign slavery, or put to death. Thus ‘ the remedy sor
a wrong to property was against the person: for a wrong to the person
it was against the property,’ and this explains why actions on delict,
even when partly rei persecutoriae, ‘ in heredem non dantur.' A delict
calls for the exercise of private vengeance, which, however, has nothing
to act upon as soon as the wrongdoer is dead ; his heir succeeds to
his universitas iuris, of which his feuds :and hostilities are no part ;
and as the poena is paid as the price of exemption from personal
hostility, it must be paid by the wrongdoer and no one else.

limitation, as anarchy began to give way to order, providing sor the
establishment and rendering certain ·of -claims of man against man.
In the case of a wrong or a debt whose existence no one could doubt,

the system might, as things stood, seem tolerable enough; but it could -

n'ot long be endured if every pretended injury or obligation were to
entitle the complainant to proceed thus against the object os his ani-
mosity. The expedient which seems to have suggested itself to the
primitive Romans was to require clear and adequate evidence of every
right or wrong which was not otherwise beyond question, and to
attribute to the witnesses a kind of interest in the realization of justice,
by identifying them, in a sense, with the person who was supported
by their testimony; if the latter were compelled to resort to seif-
redress, they were under a moral obligation to afford him active
assistance3 in default they became no less improbi and intestabiles
than the false or recalcitrant witness of a mancipation ⁸. A ‘ testis' is
conceived, originally, less as a witness, in the modern sense, than as
