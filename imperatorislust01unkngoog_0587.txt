in heredem non competere, veluti furti, vi bonorum raptorum,
iniuriarum, damni iniuriae. sed heredibus huiusmodi actiones
competunt nec denegantur, excepta iniuriarum actione et si
qua alia similis inveniatur. aliquando tamen etiam ex con-
tractu actio contra heredem non competit, cum testator dolose
versatus sit et ad heredem eius nihil ex eo dolo pervenerit.

principalibus personis suerint contestatae, et heredibus dantur

whom it originally accrued, may still be exercised by his heir, is said
to be actively transmissible3 one which, though not exercised against
the person originally liable, may still be exercised against his heir, is
said to be passively transmissible.

Active transmission, as Justinian remarkS, is the rule. Those rights
of action only are excepted (of which the actio iniuriarum is here taken
as a type) which are grounded not on a damnum or injury to property,
but on a grievance or insult to the person; e. g. among others, the
querella inofficiosi testamenti, Dig. 5. 2. 6. 2, and the remedy of a patron
or pater against a freedman or child who commenced legal proceedings
against him without the praetor-’s permission, Tit. 16. 3 inf. The point of
the distinction is well put by Theophilus, ἔνθα γὰρ τὸ γενόμενον ἁμάρτημα
ε’λαττοῖ τὴν τοῦ μέλλοντος τελευτᾷν περιουσίαν, τότε καὶ ὁ κληρονόμος, ὣς
συναδικούμενος, τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἁμαρτήματος ἀγωγὴν κινῆσει . . . Ἐπειδὴ . . . οὔ
μειοῖ τὴν ὑπόστασιν, εἰκότως καὶ ὁ κληρονόμος ὁ ἐμός, ὣς μὴ συναδικηθείς,
ταύτην οὔχ ἕξει.

The chief exceptions to passive transmission are the actiones populareS,
Dig. 47. 23. 7. 8, and (as is observed in the text) penal actions arising ex
delicte. Actions which are purely poenae persecutoriae are passively
transmissible only when they are absolutely the only remedy on the
wrong (e. g. the actio on calumnia, Dig. 3. 6. 5. pn), and then only so far
as the inheritance has been enriched thereby; and this same principle of
the liability of the heir to the extent to which the inheritance has been
benefited applies also to actions (1) which, though grounded on delict,
are purely rei persecutoriae (e. g. actio doli, Dig. 4. 3. 17. 1, quod metus
causa, Dig. 4. 2. 16. 2) ; (2) which are mixtae, except where an aetion
which is purely rei persecutoria lies on the same delict (e.g. the condictio
furtiva on rapina, Dig. 47. 8. 2. 27). Condictio furtiva, not being based
on delict, lies against the thiei’s heir in solidum, Tit. 1. 19 supr„ Dig. 13.
1. 7. 2 3 ib. 9.

The examples given by Gaius (iv. 113) of actions which, though arising
ex contractu, are either actively or passively untransmissible, create no
difficulty: ‘ adstipulatoris heres non habet actionem, et sponsoris et fide·
promissoris non tenetur! But Justinian’s statement in the text that where
a party to a contract has been guilty of dolus his heir is not suable, if he
has personally derived no advantage from the fraud, is contradicted by a

large number of passages in the Corpus iuris 3 e. g. Dig. 50. 17. 157. 2 ι ‘ in
