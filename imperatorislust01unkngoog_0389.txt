parebit. Erat et ex senatus consulto Claudiano miserabilis 1
per universitatem adquisiti0, cum libera mulier servili amore
bacchata ipsam libertatem per senatus consultum amittebat

DE OBLIGATIONIBUS.

Nunc transeamus ad obligationes. obligatio est iuris vin·
culum, quo necessitate adstringimur alicuius solvendae rei
secundum nostrae civitatis iura. Omnium autem obligationum 1

the actions which they brought sor the establishment of their claims, and
by whom the assets were sold in lots; the proceeds of the sale were
distributed by the judge among the creditorS, in a determinate order of
priority (sor which see Poste's Gaius p. 352). Property which the insol·
vent might subsequently acquire remained liable to successive sales, until
the creditors had been paid in full.

Embarrassed debtors could also usually avail themselves of a pro·
cedure more in the nature of a voluntary composition with creditors,
called cessio bonorum (Bk. iii. 25. 8; iv. 6. 403 ib. ¹4· 4 infi), which was
introduced by a lex Iulia of one of the two first Caesars. By adopting
this course they escaped liability to arrest and imprisonment, Cod. 7. 71.
1, which bankrupts proper might still incur if the missio in bona produced
no results ; a debtor could be committed to prison at the outset only on
the application of the Treasury. F urther, they did not become infames,
like bankrupts, Cod. 2. 12. 2, and were allowed to retain so much os their
aster-acquired property as was necessary for their subsistente (beneficium
competentiae, see on Bk. iv. 6. 37 infi), Dig. 42. 3. 4, Cod. 7. 71. 1. No
debtor, however, could claim to make a cessio bonorum whose insol·
vency was due to his own fault, Cod. 7. 71. 8. pr. The procedure aster
the surrender seems in all essential points to have been the same as in
bankruptcy.

ξ 1. For the SC. Claudianum see on Bk. i. 3. 4 supr.

A mode of universal succession described by Gaius (iii. 85-87), but not
alluded to by Justinian, as being obsolete in his day, is in iure cessio of
an heredit as by an agnate entitled on intestacy, for which see p. 2 56 supr.
It seems improper to regard this as a universal succession, for what the
agnate transferred was, not the hereditaS, but the single right of becoming
heres to a succession as yet only delata.
