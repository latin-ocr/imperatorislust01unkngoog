exheres esto ’ non adiecto proprio nomine, scilicet si alius
filius non extet. postumi quoque liberi vel heredes institui

quod et in filio postumo et in quolibet ex ceteris liberis sive
feminini sexus sive masculini praeterito valet quidem testa-
mentum, sed postea adgnatione postumi sive postumae
rumpitur et ea ratione totum infirmatur: ideoque si mulier,
ex qua postumus aut postuma sperabatur, abortum fecerit,
nihil impedimento est scriptis heredibus ad hereditatem ade-
undam. sed seminini quidem sexus personae vel nominatim
vel inter ceteros exheredari solebant, dum tamen, si inter
ceteros exheredentur, aliquid eis legetur, ne videantur per
oblivionem praeteritae esse, masculos vero postumos, id est
filium et deinceps, placuit non aliter recte exheredari, nisi

the making osa will τ postumi sui are those persons who come under the
immediate (Tit. 19. 2 inf.) power of the testator after the execution of the
will, or would have done se, if he had not died first. Thus they com-
prise (1) postumi sui proper, the testator-’s own children, sons and
daughters, born aster the execution of the will, who become sui by the
mere fact of birth ς (2) persons postumorum suorum loco, i. e. (a) those
adopted or adrogated, and children legitimated by the testator after
making the will, Gaius ii. 138, Tit. 17. 1 infi, Ulpian, reg. 23. 3 ; (b) filii-
familias or filiaefamilias who become sui by ‘ successio in suorum heredum
locum’ as described in Gaius ii. 133, and § 2 inf. ; and (c) the child who
fell under the immediate power and so became suus heres of his soldier
father by the death of the grandfather in whose power both of them had
previously been: he is postumus in relation to his father’s will of
castrense peculium made while a filiusfamilias, Dig. 28. 2. 28. 1.

Postumi were ‘incertae personae’ (Tit. 20. 25 ἰοί), and therefore by
the old law could be neither instituted heirs nor disinherited, Ulpian,
reg. 22. 4: consequently, if they were sui, the will necessarily became
void. It was only by very gradual steps that it became possible to in-
stitute or disinherit postumi sui. In the most pressing case, viz. where
a postumus suus was born aster the testator’s decease, so that he could
not mend matters by executing a fresh will-the civil law itself tolerably
early permitted his institution or exheredation, Ulpian, reg. 22. 19.
Doubtless the rule was the same in respect of a grandchild in utero
whose father was no longer in the testator’s power at the time of the
making of the will, though he had been when the child was conceived.
Eventually testators were enabled to institute or disinherit all grand·
children postumi sui, partly under a formula introduced by Gallus

Aquilius, Cicero’s coueague in the praetorship, Dig. 28. 2. 29. pn, partly
