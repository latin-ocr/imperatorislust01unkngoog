by different obligations against two or more debtorS, or one debtor
bound by different obligations to two or more creditors ; but these
obligationS, though different from one another, may have one and the
same obJect (act or forbearance): not similar objectS, such as the
payment of the 1ol. penalty above, but the same object ; so that
when that object is once attained by the performance of one of the
obligationS, all the rest, no longer having any object, cease ipso facto
to exist. E. g. A, B, and C jointly break my windows. Each is under
3 separate obligation ‘to pay me for mending them, and I may sue
which I please, apart from the rest, for the expenses to which I have
been put; but if 1 recover the amount of the glazier’s bill from A, 1
can no longer get it from B or C, for the claim is a civil one for com-
pensation, not a quasi-criminal one for a penalty. In such a case,
there are as many separate obligations as there are debitores, but the
object of all these obligations is the same: each debtor is, therefore,
liable sor the whole object, or liable in solidum (as distinct from the
liability pro parte exemplified by a joint promise to pay 151), but as
the object is only one, it can only be once attained‚ and therefore
performance by one of the joint debtors releases the rest. This is
called solidary obligation: and as two or more debtors can be
solidarily bound to one creditor (passive solidarity), so two or more
creditors can be solidarily entitled against one debtor (active soli-
darity); i. e. either or any one of them can, without consulting the
other or rest, claim the whole object (which forms the connecting link
between the different obligations) from the single debtor 3 but as soon
as he has done what he has to do for one, the vinculum iuris between
him and all is severed‚ and he is free. The predominance of passive
over active solidary obligation is so great that some writers have
supposed the latter to have no real existence. There is a clear case of
it, however, in Dig. 9. 4. 14. pr., though owing to its rareness we
need not concern ourselves with it here.

Cases of the passive form are (1) the joint commission of a delict:
the obligation of the co-delinquents to make compensation (though
not to pay a penalty) is solidary, Dig. 2. 10. 1. 4.; 4. 2. 14. 153
13. 1. 1. (2) The liability of cotutors for dolus and culpa in the dis-
charge of their functions, Dig. 16. 3. 1. 433 26. 7. 18. 1 3 27. 3. 1. 13.
(3) Where two or more persons jointly incur a contractual but not
correal (sor which see below) liability (e. g. A and B j0intly agree to
act as agents for C, Dig. 17. 1. 60. 2 ; or as his depositaries, Dig. 16.
3. 1. 433 or jointly borrow a thing for use, Dig. 13. 6. 5. 15), they are
bound solidarily in respect of the duties which arise from the contr-act.
