DE TESTAMENTIS onnINANmS.

Testamentum ex eo appellatur, quod testatio mentis est.

Sed ut nihil antiquitatis penitus ignoretur, sciendum est 1
olim quidem duo genera testamentorum in usu fuisse, quorum
altero in pace et in otio utebantur, quod calatis comitiis
appellabatur, altero, cum in proelium exituri essent, quod
procinctum dicebatur. accessit deinde tertium genus testa-
mentorum, quod dicebatur per aes et libram, scilicet qnia per
emancipationem, id est imaginariam quandam venditionem,
agebatur quinque testibus et libripende civibus Romanis
puberibus praesentibus et eo qui familiae emptor dicebatur.

by both Gaius and Justinian. The two modes of succession are mutually
exclusive. 1f a man made a will, all his property (unless he were a
soldier) must perforce go to the heir or heirs therein instituted, even
though expressly instituted to certain portions of it only: there was
nothing lest for the rules os intestate succession to operate on, or to go to
the person or persons who would have succeeded him had he died in-
testate : ‘neque enim idem ex parte testatus et ex parte intestatus de-
cedere potest‚ nisi sit miles’ Tit. 14. 5 inf. z cf. Cicero, de invent. 2. 21.
Two other technical terms require a brief explanation. In some cas'es
the law cast the inheritance upon a person or persons whether they
wished it or not, Tit. 19. 1 and 2 inf. : immediately upon a man’s decease
they became heirs ipso sacta, and could in no way at law disencumber
themselves of the legal rights and duties, taken in the aggregate, which
that character imposed upon them. But in other cases (Tit. 19. 5 ins.) no
one became heres immediately, though some one (or more) was entitled
to become so if he pleased : here, as soon as it was known who was the
person so entitled, the hereditas was said to be ‘ delata ’ to him : delatio
is the right actually to become heir : ‘ delata hereditas intellegitur, quam
quis possit adeundo consequi ' Dig. 50. 16. 151. If, after consideration,
he decides that the inheritance is worth taking, delatio is followed by
aditio (Tit. 19. 5 and 7 infi), actual acceptance of the succession. First
comes the death ; then delatio 3 and finally, after a greater or less interval,
aditio. But, whether the law makes one heir nolens volens, or whether
one deliberately accepts the inheritance after fully weighing its advan-
tages and disadvantages, one cannot get rid of the character of hereS,
with all its liabilities, when one has once been invested with it : ‘ semel
heres, semper heres.’ How far this principle, as well as the other already
cited supr. from Tit. 14. 5, had been modified at the end of justinian’s
legislative work will appear from the following Titles.
