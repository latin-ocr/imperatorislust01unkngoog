The Twelve Tables had also allowed the relations of a person who had
suffered an aggravated outrage to sue for talio on his behalf, p. 522 supr. ;
and the legis actio repetundarum could, under the statutes by which it
was regulated (e. g. Calpurnia, Servilia), be brought ΒΥ a Roman citiaen
on behalf of the persons really injured.

The introduction of the formulary procedure facilitated representation
of defendants no less than of plaintiffs. From this time onward it was
allowed by the praetor with but slight limitations ς the desired end being
attained by the principal’s name appearing in the intentio of the formula,
the agent's in the condemnatio; e. g. ‘si paret Caium Seio (principal)
sestertium decem milia dare oportere, iudex Caium Titio (agent) ses-
tertium decem milia condemna : si non paret, absolve (Gaius iv. 86, 87).
Of such agents there were two typeS. The older of these is the cognitor,
who was appointed for a single action (in litem) in the presence of the
other party, certis et sollennibus verbis, the formulae of which are pre-
served by Gaius iv. 83. There could thus be no question of the cog-
nitor’s authority, and consequently he was identified with his principa!
throughout ς his processual acts affected the latter exactly as if they had
been his own: ‘domini loco habetur’ Gaius iv. 97. ΤΒε other is the
procurator, who might be a general agent, acting even without com-
mission3 ‘quin etiam sunt qui putant vel eum procuratorem videri, cui
non sit mandatum, si modo bona fide accedat ad negotium, et caveat
rem ratam dominum habiturum3 igitur etsi non edat mandatum pro-
curator, nihilominus agere posse, quia saepe mandatum initio litis in
obscuro est, et postea apud iudicem ostenditur' Gaius iv. 84. The pro·
curator thus stood upon an altogether different footing from the cognitor,
for the alleged principal might turn out to be no principal at all, or at
any rate not to have consented to the agent’s bringing or defending the
action for him: consequently, he was not identified with the latter, as
the cognitor was, and was in fact the real party to the action himself.
Hence, if he appeared as plaintiffi the principal's right of action was not
consumed, so that he could subsequently sue upon it himself (Gaius iv.
98), and the agent alone could bring actio iudicati against the defendant,
if condemned, fragm. Vat. 317 ; if he appeared as defendant, it was he,
and not the principal, against whom the actio iudicati must be brought
if the case went against him. ΤΒο general consequence of this non-
identification of procurator with his dominus was that he was allowed
to appear as plaintiff or defendant only upon the condition that the other
party to the action was fully protected against the risk of the principal's
disowning his proceedings by subsequently suing upon the same ground
himself, or by refusing to satisfy an adverse judgment. This was effected
by the system of security described in the next Title.

Between Gaius and Justinian the cognitor disappeared, and when
there was no doubt that a procurator really was what he held himself
