§ 9. This is only. an illustration of the rule that the status of children
born of lawful wedlock was determined at the time os their conception,
because they followed the condition of their father: ‘ hi qui legitime con-
cipiuntur ex conceptionis tempore statum sumunt ’ Gaius i. 89. On the
other hand, illegitimate children followed the condition os their mother,
being ‘spurii,’ Tit. 10. 12 supr„ and accordingly in the time of Gaius
their condition was determined by her status at the time of birth: sor
the later modification of this rule see Tit. 4, and note supr.

11 the potestas were terminated in some mode by which the filius-
familias underwent capitis deminutio, he ceased to belong to his previous
agnatic family, and thereby lost all his rights of intestate succession and
guardianship to its members: consequently the distinction between
modes in which this occurred and those in which it did not is im-
portant. The former are three in number: loss os libertas or civitas
(apart from the ius postliminii), emancipation‚ and subjection to some
other power, whether potestaS‚ manus, or mancipium (e. g. the latter as.
produced in noxal surrender- before justinian).

Ἧι. m Tutela was originally conceived rather as a right than as
a duty (whence the phrase ‘tutelam nancisci,' Tit. 12. 6. supr., Tit. 19.
pr. int), but in Justinian’s time it had become a publicum munus
(Tit. 25. pr. inf.), a stinction which the state required all its qualified
members to discharge is called upon, and from which they could be ex-
