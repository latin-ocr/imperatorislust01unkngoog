of the possessory interdicta and thus of the whole law of possession
as distinct from ownership. But the praetor’s real power to intro·
duce new legal principles dates from the lex Aebutia (circ. nc. 170)
which (Gaius iv. 30) practically superseded the legis actiones in the
majority of cases by a new form of procedure, by which the praetor
was enabled to grant actions (actiones honorariae) not based on the
civil law. He did this at first mainly by the employment of fictions3
in the formula in which he indicated to the iudex the issue to be
tried he referred to some rule of law already established, by analogy
with which the present case was to be decided (Gaius iv. 32-38).
Subsequently, becoming bolder, he habitually granted actions on
grounds of which there was not even a shadowy recognition in the
civil law, and whose formula consequently contained no reference to
rules or principles which that law had established.=

As has been already observed, the form in which praetorian changes

were made in the law was the edict. The higher magistrates of ·

Rome had always possessed the ius edicendi, the right of issuing to
the people public and imperative notices on matters* which fell
within their jurisdiction or formed part of their official business. The
censors issued edicts relating to a coming census3 the consuls in this
way summoned the senate and the comitia, and Plautus speaks of
edictiones aedilicias regulating the public markets. The praetor, as
invested with the supreme civil jurisdiction, would naturally find the
most frequent occasion for publishing such edicts‚ and it became usual
for him, at the commencement of his year of office, to proclaim in
this manner the principles which, apart from the established rules of
the ius civile, he intended to observe in the administration of justice.

Such proclamation was no small security for the impartial treatment
of all suitors, and saved the citizen from the hardships of ex post

facto legislation ; it thus became a constitutions] obligation of every
praetor, on taking office, to state the general rules by which, as chief
judicia] magistrate, he should guide himself during the year. This
edict, which he issued at the commencement of his administration,
was called edictum perpetuum, because the practice was constant and
unbroken‚ and was contrasted with edicta repentina, isolated orders
made by the praetor during and not at the commencement of his
year of office, and generally, though not always, relating to some
specific case. The distinction between edictum perpetuum and
edictum repentinum is thus not identical with Austin's distinction be·
