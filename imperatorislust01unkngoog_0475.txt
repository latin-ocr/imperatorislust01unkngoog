THE GENERAL ’ΝΑ Τ URE OF OBLIGA T IONS . 463

the 'creditor is unable to sue. Two such reasons have a very ex-
tensive operation, viz.—

(1) Insufficiency of form in contractS. We shall see that in Roman
law agreements were actionable only if they were clothed in a definite
form, or belonged to one or other of certain classes specially favoured';
exactly as in English law no promise is legally binding unless made
either under seal or for valuable consideration. Agreements which
neither belonged to the favoured classes, nor were expressed in the
proper form, were nuda pacta, and unactionable, although (according
to Savigny and many other writers) they gave rise to a natural obliga-
tion enforceable in other ways. This is inserted in particular from
Dig. 2. 14. 7. 4 ‘igitur nuda pactio obligationem non parit, sed parit
exceptionem,’ ib. r. pr. ‘ huius edicti aequitas naturalis est: quid
enim tam congruum fidei humanae, quam ea, quae inter eos placu-
erunt, servari: Dig. 46. 3. 5. 2 ⁶ . . . puta, quaedam earum [usurarum]
ex stipulatione, quaedam ex pacto naturaliter debebantur: . . . et sicut
ex pacti conventione datae repeti non possunt ς’· cf. Dig. ib. 95. 4·.
On the other hand, the passage last ci'ted is the only one in which the
effect of producing natural obligation is directly attributed ‘to a mere
pact ; and on account of this insufficiency os evidence there are many
who hold that Savigny is not justified in affirming natural obligation
as an incident of nuda pacta in general. Most directly they are sup-
ported by Dig. 45. 1. 1. 2 ‘ si quis ita interroget, dabis? responderit, ,
quidni? et is utique in ea causa est, ut obligetur. Contra si sine
verbis adnuisset, non tanturn autem civiliter, sed nec naturaliter obli-
gatur, qui ita adnuit: et ideo recte dictum est, non obligari pro eo
nec fideiussorem quidem.'

(2) A person’s defective capacity of right or disposition. Thus,
between pater and filiusfamilias and between master and slave, there
could be natural obligation only, and even to· an extranea persona a
slave could not be bound civiliter. The SC. Macedonianum (Bk. iv.
7. 7 and notes inf.) affords another example: a disputed case is that
of contracts made by a pupillus without his guardian's auctoritas3 see
on Bk. i. 21. pr. supr.

SometimeS, moreover‚ an obligation which was originally civilis
ceased to be actionable‚ and became naturalis. (a) In some cases the
praetor, on principles of equity, disregarded strict civil law rules so sar
as to permit the survival, in a ⁸ natural' form, of an obligation which
had iure civili ceased altogether to exist, e. g. where a creditor became
heir to his debtor, and in capitis deminutiO, ‘ hi qui capite minuuntur,
ex his causis, quae capitis deminutionem praecesserunt, manent obli-
