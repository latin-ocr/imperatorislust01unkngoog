Re contrahitur obligatio veluti mutui datione. mutui autem
obligatio in his rebus consistit, quae pondere numero men-
surave constant, veluti vino oleo frumento pecunia numerata
aere argento auro, quas res aut numerando aut metiendo aut
pendendo in hoc damuS, ut accipientium fiant et quandoque
nobis non eaedem reS, sed aliae eiusdem naturae et qualitatis
reddantur. unde etiam mutuum appellatum sit, quia ita a me
tibi datur, ut ex meo tuum fiat. ex eo contractu nascitur

litterarum 3 and (4) in transactions of four specific kinds the mere agree-
ment (consensus) of the parties ε whence the consensual contracts of
sale, hire, partnership, and agency. How other parts besides these were
gradually made actionable, though not dignified by the Romans with the
name of contract (which is less a legal than a historical term) will appear
as we proceed.

1t is difficult to say why Gaius (whom Justinian follows) discussed the
four classes of contracts in the order—Real, Verbal, Literal, and Consen-
sual. Mr. Poste supposes that it was perhaps the order of their
chronological development, here following Savigny, who holds that
mutuum was the earliest contract which the Roman law enforced by
action: sor an acute criticism of this hypothesis, and of Ortolan’s and
Sir Henry Maine’s theory that there was a time when the Roman law
possessed but one common form for contract and conveyance (the nego·
tium per aes et libram), see Hunter’s Roman Law pp. 3 52-379, where the
whole question of the origin and development of the Roman contract
system is well and fully discussed.

The real and consensual contracts were said to be iuris gentium ε and

to suppose that one of these (mutuum), at any rate in the form in which
we know it, was actionable at Rome before the formal civil law contract

of stipulatio seems entirely opposed to the general conclusions of
historical law. On the other hand it must be admitted that mutuum
seems to stand clearly apart from the three other real contracts: the
remedy on it was condicti0, a stricti iuris iudicium, while they were all
pursued by bonae fidei actions; and in mutuum the borrower is made
owner of the thing horrowed3 the lender ‘dat,' i. e. parts with his own
dominium: whereas in the other three nothing is ever transferred beyond
possession, so that the transferor can always in case of breach recover
his own by real action. These in fact seem to have been derived from
fiducia (the nature of which has been already described, p. 315 supr.), and
the action on which was bonae fidei, Gaius iv. 62: the difficulty of ascrib-
ing the same origin to mutuum lies in the difference of the remedy.
