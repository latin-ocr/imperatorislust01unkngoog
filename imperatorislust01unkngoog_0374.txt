bona eorum iure quodammodo peculii ex lege Iunia manu-

as they were free at the parents' decease, Tit. 6. 10 supr. ; in default of
these, by the patron or patroness ; thirdly, by the latter's children
according to proximity, without regard to capitis deminutio ; and lastly,
by the patron or patroness’ collaterals to the fifth degree.

quasi hereditario iure, practically as his nearest agnate ; but he took that
of his Latinus IunianuS, whom the lex Iunia Norbana had disabled from
making a will, p. 244 supra, simply as his master, {iure quodammodo

manumittet, devisable by him, along with the rest of his fortune, to whom-

succeeded on intestacy by a relation or quasi-relation, while a Latinus
