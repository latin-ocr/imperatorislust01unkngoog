EARLIER HIS T ORY OF ROMAN CIVJL PROCEDURE. 619

system of actions tn'ed before a judge or judges took its origin. The
earliest judges derived their judicia} authority, such as it was, not from
the state, but from the voluntary submission of the parties: and
Sir H.2Maine has shown ¹, by an examination of the earliest Roman
civil process that the magistrate, even when commissioned by the
state for the administration of justice, preserved the memory of the
actual historical source of his functions by ‘carefully simulating the

demeanour of a private arbitrator casually called in! The later Roman ·

jurists, though struck by the similarity in procedure between an ordi·
nary action and a reference to arbitration‚ were guilty of the curious
anachronism of deriving the latter from the former: ‘ compromissum ⁹
(one orthem says) ‘ad similitudinem iudiciorum redigitur 3' but the
fact is that action grew out of arbitratiom and the judge was originally
only an unofficial referee; a fact of which traces are observable
throughout the legal history of Rome. Thus, no action could
validly be commenced, still less carn‘ed through to judgment, until the
court had got both parties before it: for arbitration can take place
only by consent, not by a unilateral act of either of them without the
other. Still more forcibly are we reminded of the mode in which the
early judge acquired his jurisdiction by the vitality of the rule that no
judge could be forced upon a party of whose knowledge and integrity
he was not satisfied: ‘neminem,’ says Cicero ², ‘voluerunt maiores
nostri non modo de existimatione cuiusquam, sed ne pecuniaria quidem
de re minima esse iudicem, nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset.'
Hence too the limited authority, as we should deem it, of the Roman
iudex 3 he has no ‘imperium ς’ he cannot compel the parties to any
act or forbearance; he is merely a reseree whom they have chosen,
and in whose appointment the magistrate has cooperated; all he has
to do is to decide the questions submitted to him, so sar as the par·
ties may enable him3 he has to leave to them the realization (by exe-
cution) of the right he ascertains. The very point he has actually to
settle is at first kept studiously in the background, and hidden behind
a wager ς the decision is not an order or injunction, but an expression
of opinion, sententia, pronuntiatio.

In England we know from actual records with what rapidity trial by
jury in civil causes, though in most cases optional only, superseded the
more barbarous methods of compurgation, ordeal, and trial by battle,
and that this was largely due to a sense os the greater justice and reason-
ableness of the new system. We can hardly doubt that upon much

the same grounds the practice of arbitration daily gained greater
