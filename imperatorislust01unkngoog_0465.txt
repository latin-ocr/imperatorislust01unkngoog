condicio adiciatur, novationem fieri, sic intellegi oportet, ut
ita dicamus factam novationem, si condicio extiterit: alioquin
si defecerit, durat prior obligatiO. Sed cum hoc quidem
inter veteres constabat tunc fieri novationem, cum novandi
animo in secundam obligationem itum fuerat: per hoc autem
dubium erat, quandonovandi animo videretur hoc fieri et
quasdam de hoc praesumptiones alii in aliis-casibus intro-
ducebant: ideo nostra processit constitutiO, quae apertissime
definivit tunc solum fieri novationem, quotiens hoc ipsum
inter contrahentes expressum fuerit, quod propter novationem
prioris obligationis convenerunt, alioquin manere et pristinam
obligationem et secundam ei accedere, ut maneat ex utraque
causa obligatio secundum nostrae constitutionis definitioneS,

naturalem transfusio atque translatio, hoc est, cum· ex praecedenti causa
ita nova constituatur, at prior perimatur’ Dig. 46. 2. ι. pr. ; novation is
the extinction os one obligation by the substitution for it of another.
Originally it could take place in two wayS, transcriptio (Excursus VIII
inf.) and stipulatio 3 but in Justinian's time the latter was the only means
available for the purpose. The end in view in a novation may be either
to change one of the parties to the subsisting obligation, or, without
changing the parties,‘t0- alter its nature either by converting a real or
consensual into a verbal obligation or by modisying its termS. The first
of these ends is illustrated in the text by the words veluti si id . . . in
posteriorem3 the second, by the paragraph commencing sed si eadem
ersona . . . .

p Τὴε parties may be changed in two wayS. Firstly, the creditor
may be changed, the amount and terms of the debt remaining the same.
Thus, if A owes B 5l., and C (with B's consent) stipulates from A for
payment os that debt to himself, A's debt to B is extinguished. The
same effect might be produced, though perhaps with a difference of
remedy, without novation, by B's assigning his rights against A to C,
Gaius ii. 38, 39, Excursus V inf. Secondly, the debtor might be changed,
the creditor remaining the same. Thus, if under the circumstances
supposed, B stipulated from C for payment to himself of the 5l. which A
owed him, A’s debt to B would be cancelled. If this was done with A's
assent, it is usually called delegatio ; if not, ex promissio ; but see Poste’s
Gaius, p. 670.

It is immaterial whether the obligation which is novated be civilis or
merely naturalis ε its extinction involves that of all rights which were
accessory to it, such as guarantieS, hypothecS, claims sor interest and
penaltie3‚ etc„ Dig. 46. 2. 153 ib. 183 ib. 27 ; ib. 29. So too, as is said
in the text, the obligation created by the novating contract will ex-
tinguish the old one even though it be natural only, i. e. sor some reason
