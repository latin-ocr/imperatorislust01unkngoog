474 EXCURSUS VJJ.

Such joint contr-acts will not, however, in themselves create active
solidat-y obligatiom Dig. 16. 3. 1. 36 ; ·ib. 14. pr. (4) In mandatum
qualificatum (Bk. iii. 26. 5) j0int mandators incur solidary liability if
the debtor is unable to pay himself, Dig. 46. 1. 52. 13: so too with
constitutum debiti alieni (note on Bk. iii. 20. 8). (5) Where one
room is jointly occupied by two or more persons they are liable in
solidum to the actio de effusis et deiectiS, Bk. iv. 5. 1 infr„ Dig. 9.
3. 1. τος ib. 2-4.

Solidary obligation is terminated — i. e. all the solidary debtors
are released, and the right of all the solidary creditors is extin-
guished — by simple satisfaction of the sole creditor, or by satis-
faction os one of the 'creditors by the single debtor. This may
occur (1) by performance, solutio, or (2) by set-off extending to
the whole of the debt. But aequittal of one solidat-y debtor in
an· action brought on his obligation did not release the rest from
theirs: ⁶ plures eiusdem pecuniae mandatoreS, si unus iudicio eligatur,
absolutione quoque secuta non liberantur, sed omnes liberantur pecunia
soluta,' Dig. 46. 1. 25. 3. Acceptilatio (Bk. iii. 29. 1) was equally
inoperative, for it is neither payment nor equivalent to it: and novatio
(ib. ξ 3) extinguished solidary liability only so far as the object of the
new obligation was quantitatively equivalent to that of the old, Cod.
2. 4. 1. In short, the intervention of any event, which ordinarily
destroys an obligation, between the creditor and one of the joint
debtors, or between the debtor and one os the joint creditors, does
not affect the liability of the other debtorS, or the right of the other
creditors, unless it is or amounts to performance.

But, though the ultimate liability of each of several solidary debtors
for the whole object of the obligations is clear, each ordinarily enjoyed
the following rights τ (α) except where he had been guilty of dolus, or
of culpa in excess of the rest, he could claim to be primarily sued
only for an aliquot part os the debt: he could be called upon to pay
more only if the rest or some of them were insolvent (beneficium
divisionis). (b) If another or others of the debtors had been exces-
sively in fault, he could in some cases (e. g. cotutorS, Dig. 26. 7. 3. 2)
demand that he or they should be sued before him (beneficium ordinis
sive excussionis). (c) Where he had not been guilty of dolus (Dig.
27. 3. 1. 14) and paid the whole, he had a ius regressus against the
rest by which he could recover their respective shares of what he had
pald. In (ι) supr. this right os course did not exist: ‘ in pari delicto
potior est condicio defendentis?
