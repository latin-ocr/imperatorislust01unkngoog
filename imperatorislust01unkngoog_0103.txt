Tit. 1.] DE JUsTJTJA ET [ΗΒΕ. 91

laedere, suum cuique tribuere. Huius studii duae sunt 4
positiones, publicum et privatum. publicum ius est, quod ad
statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum, quod ad singulorum
utilitatem pertinet. dicendum est igitur de iure privam, quod
est tripertitum ε collectum est enim ex naturalibus praeceptis
aut gentium aut civilibus.

may be, however, that Ulpian, from whom pr. and §§ 1 and 3 of this
Title are taken, and in whose ‘ Regulae,' Bk. i, they stand in close con-
nection, meant § 3 to be an expansion or explanation of pr. 3 by enounc-
ing, as the first precept of the law, a rule relating to oneself and not to
other personS, he intended to say, that although justice is what he defines
it to be in pr.‚ it is not yet enough to injure no one, and to give every
man his due, in order to save oneself from collision with the law: the
law also punishes any unworthy conduct by which one's own personality
is degraded.

ξ 4. Public law ‘in sacriS, in sacerdotibuS, in magistratibus consistit ’
Dig. 1. 1. 1. 2. In the Roman view it comprised two parts z (1) constitu-
tional law in its widest sense, i.e. the law which determines in whom the
sovereign power shall reside, how it shall be exercised‚ and to what
checks the persons among whom it may be distributed shall be subject.
It thus embraces all administrative law, which indeed under the later
Empire formed its largest portion ; see the account of T heodosius' Code
in the General Introduction, p. 62, supr. Another important portion of
it was the ius sacrum, even aster Constantine had made Christianity the
national religion. (2) Criminal law: privata delicta (torts) were distin-
guished from publica delicta or crimes ε ‘ publica crimina, quorum delatio
omnibus conceditur’ Cod. 9. 9. 30. pr.‚ see Bk. iv. 18. 1. inf.

It is of course impossible to draw a persectly hard and fast line be-
tween public and private law, and this was for historical reasons par-
ticularly true os Rome (General Introd. p. 16 sq., supr.) 3 many institutions
are from one point of view regarded as publici, from another as privati
iuris ; thus tutela, though discussed in the Instituta, was a munus pub-
licum, and so in Dig. 28. 1. 3, it is said ‘testamenti factio publici iuris
est! civil procedure, from the prominence with which it is treated in
Bk. iv, ‘and also by GaiuS‚ was apparently considered a part of private
law 3 but by many this is regarded as arbitr-ary and unjustifiable, on the
ground that rules of procedure are properly rules determining how the
powers of certain officers (magistrates and judges) shall be exercised.

‘Ibe division of the whole body of law observed within the limits of
any given state into public and private, though as old as Aristotle (Rhet.
i. 13. 3), and adopted by the modern civilians no less than by the Roman
jurists, is severely criticised and rejected by Austin (Jurisprudence,
lect. 44), who would make the so-called public law part of the law of
persons. This is scientifically correct if we take law of personS, as he
does, in a sense very different from that given to it by its originators:
