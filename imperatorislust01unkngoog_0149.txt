Tit. ιι] QUIBUS MODIS IUS POTESTATIS SOLVITUR. 137

hoc in melius per constitutionem reformavit, ut fictione pristina
explosa recta via apud competentes iudices vel magistratus
parentes intrent et filios suos vel filias vel nepotes vel neptes
ac deinceps sua manu dimitterent. et tunc ex edicto praetoris
in huius filii vel filiae, nepotis vel neptis bonis, qui vel quae a
parente manumissus vel manumissa fuerit, eadem iura prae-
stantur parenti, quae tribuuntur patrono in bonis liberti: et
praeterea si impubes sit filius vel filia vel ceteri, ipse parens ex

manumissione tutelam eius* nanciscitur. Admonendi autem 7

sumus liberum esse arbitrium ei, qui filium et ex eo nepotem
vel neptem in potestate habebit, filium quidem de potestate
dimittere, nepotem vero vel neptem retinere: et ex diverso
filium quidem in potestate retinere, nepotem vero vel neptem
manumittere (eadem et de pronepote vel pronepte dicta esse

however, if he did not protest against the emancipation: ‘solvere ius
potestatis invitis filiis non est permissum patribus’ N ov. 89. 1 ι pr. (3) Due
performance of the act of emancipation. This, as described by Gaius
(i. 132), was effected by the pater’s mancipating the child to a friend fidu-
ciae causa, who remancipated him to the pater, and by the latter’s then
manumitting him, like a slave, vindicta. If it were a son three mancipa-
tions were necessary, owing to the rule of the XII Tables», ‘si pater filium
ter venumduit, a patre filius liber esto :² aster each of the two first man-
cipations he was manumitted by the alienee‚ whereby he again fell
under the patria potestas; the third mancipation was made cum fiducia,
and was followed by remancipation to, and manumission by, the eman·
cipating father, unless the remancipation were dispensed with, and the
child were actually manumitted by the alienee, usually under an agree·
ment to hold the iura patronatus in trust for the father ; see on Bk. iii. 2.
8 inf. For this clumsy form justinian substituted (Cod. 8. 49. 6) a
simple declaration before a judge or magistrate, which was registered in
the acta. ⁶ Recta via,' in the text, is explained by Cod. 8. 49. 6 ‘ sine
sacro rescripto‚' a reference to emancipation by imperial rescript, which
was introduced by Anastasius (Cod. loc. cit. 5), and was mainly resorted
to when absence of the child prevented the old form from being em-
ployed. For the effect of emancipation on filiusfamilias’ property see
Bk. ii. 9. 2, and notes inf. : he was allowed to retain his peculium pro·
fectitium unless it was expressly taken from him, fragm. Vat. 2 55. 261. of
