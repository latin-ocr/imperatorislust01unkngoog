he is capable of becoming a ‘person,' which explains the treatment of his
position in this book (Tit. 5).

ln relation to his master, the slave’s condition is one of absolute de-
pendence : hence the application to him os the rules and ideas of owner-
ship, such as the capacity os being jointly owned by co-proprietorS.
Originally, the rights of a dominus over his slave were as absolute as
over any other object of property: limitations were first imposed on
them by the Emperor& Claudius gave freedom to slaves whom their
masters had turned out os doors on account psill-hffalthorgiisease, and
punished those that killed slaves who from-some such cause had become a
burden to them. A lex Petronia (a copy of which was found in Pompeii,
so that its enactment must have been before 79 AD.) forbade slaves to
be matched against wild beasts in the arena: ‘post legem Petroniam et
senatusconsulta ad eam legem pertinentia dominis potestas ablata est,
ad bestias depugnandas suo arbitrio servos tradere. Oblato tamen iudici
servn, si iusta sit domini querela, sic poenae tradetur’ Dig. 48. 8.11.2.
Hadrian animadverted in strong terms on the arbitrary killing of slaves
without judicial sancti0n3 and finally Antoninus Pius enunciated the
general principle that they ought to be protected against unwarranted
severity, Tit. 8. 2 ins.; cf. Gaius i. 53. By -his enactment a man who
killed his own slave without just cause became liable to the penalty of the
lex Cornelia de sicariiS, Bk. i.v. 18.. 5 inf. These law5, however, must not
be supposed to have conferred rights upon the slave, and so made him a
persona 3 they merely limited the general rights of ownership on grounds
of expediency, and their rationale is well expressed by Gaius in the
passage last referred to : ‘male enim nostro iure uti non debemus ; qua
ratione et prodigis interdicitur bonorum suorum administrati0.’ For the
whole subject see Mr. Poste’s notes, Gaius, loc. cit.

§ 3. For mancipium in its more technical sense see note on Tit. 8. pr.

ς 4. The general rule of the ius gentium was that children followed the
condition of their mother, whatever might be that of the father: thus the
children of a female slave (ancilla) were born slaves themselves. Two
exceptions to this which have no relation to servile descent are noticed
by Mr. Poste on Gaius i. 76 sq. In one or two cases, however, anomalous
rules of positive law reversed the general principle, so that the children

of an ancilla were born free, those of a free-woman slaves. By the ·

SC. Claudianum (Gaius i. 84-86) it was enacted that (1) the children osa
free man by an ancilla, whom he believed to be free, should be free

if maleS, slaves if sema1e83 but this rule was repealed by Vespasian in
