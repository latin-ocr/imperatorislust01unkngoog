IUS PRAE T ORI UM-—THE EDICT. 29

than scientific. Not far different from this is the sense which it bears
in certain passages of the Digest (e.g. 47. 4. 1. ις 16. 3. 31. ι)
as equivalent to ‘ ratiO,’ the correspondence between a legal rule or
institution and the spirit of civil or natural law. In other passages
aequitas denotes (a) the agreement between mles of positive law and
the natural sense of right (e. g. naturalis aequitas Dig. 2. 14. 1 pr.;
37. 5. 1 pn), (b) the decision of a legal question with special
reference to the circumstances of the case (Dig. 44. ι4 pn), or (c)
equity in the modern sense, i.e. mitigation of strict law in accordance
with a higher sense of justice (e.g. Dig. 1. 3. 253 4. ι. 7 pr.; 15. 1.
32 pn).

The ius praetorium, which, as we have already seen, was contrasted
by the Roman lawyers with the ius civile, though equally with it a part
of the positive law of Rome, originated in the ius edicendi possessed

by the higher magistrates. The distinction between magistratus
maiores and minores was connected with the right to take the

auspices; auspicia maxima might be taken only by consuls and
praetors, on whom ‘iustum imperium auspiciumque domi et militiae ⁹
were conferred by a lex curiata. The imperium carried with it also the
ius decernendi3 a magistrate invested with imperium had the right of
issuing a decretum, of summoning a citizen (vo'catio) to appear before
him by his lictorS, of enforcing obedience to his orders by the strong
arm of the law. Some of the magistratus minoreS, e.g. the tribuni
plebis, had the ius prensioniS, the right of arresting persons present
before them and keeping them in detention; others had neither
vocatio nor prensio. The praetor, however, who, as has been re-
marked, was the supreme judicial magistrate, and who by means of
his ius edicendi was enabled to gradually develop a system of law in
which the ius civile was eventually swallowed up, had little oppor-
tunity of modifying existing law, still less of introducing new rules,
in the earliest period of his activity. This incapacity arose from the
system of procedure (legis actiones) sanctioned by the Twelve Tables
and somewhat expanded by later legislation; the forms of actions
were rigidly prescribed by statute, and the magistrate had no power
to directly alter or extend them3 stom the forms of actions only could
a citizen deduce the rights which were guaranteed him by the civil
law. The only mode in which the praetor could enforce a legal
principle not contained in that law was by an exercise of his im-
perium; he could compet a party to enter into a wager (sponsio)
with his adversary, and the fact upon which the wager turned could
then be decided in a legis actio· This, for instance, was the origin
