Tit. 3.] DE JURE PERSONARUM'. '103

favour of the old principle of the ius gentium; (2) if a free woman
cohabited with a servus alienus with the consent of the latter's master,
though she remained free herself the issue should belong to the master:
this was repealed by Hadrian, Gaius i. 84 ; (3) if a free-woman knowingly
cohabited with a servus alienus without the-consent of the latter³s master,
and persisted in the intercourse after prohibition by him, aster three
denunciations on his part she was awarded to him as a slave by the
magistrate, and her children, whether born before or aster this award‚
shared her fate : her property passed to him with her person. This was
only repealed by Justinian himself-3 Bk. iii. ·12. 1 inf.

When a free person became-a slave, he was said to suffer eapitis de·
minutio maxima (Tit. 16. 1 ini). Of this there was one mode iure
gentium, and three iure civili. (1) It was a principle of ius gentium that
a person becomes a slave by falling under the power of a foreign nation ;
this of course usually occurred in the form of capture in war, but it was
sufficient if there was no friendly ³treaty or intercourse between the two
peoples, Dig. 49. 15. 5. 2. Persons captured-in civil war did not become
slaveS, Dig. 49. 15. 21. 1, nor did those who were captured by brigands,
ib. 19. 2. Liberty lost in this way could be recovered by postliminium,
Tit. 12. 5, and notes inf. 3 Tit. 20. 2. (2) In certain cases the law allowed
a free person to be sold as a slave, e. g. those who attempted to evade
public burdens by notha-ving their names entered on t'he census, or who
shirked military service 3 so too the insolvent debtor under the old law
of execution by manus iniectio, In all these caseS, which were obsolete
long before Justinian, except possibly the last, it was necessary that the
guilty person should be sold trans Tiberim, i.e. to aforeign people. From
the time os Commodus, and possibly earlier, a libertus guilty of gross in-
gratitude to his patron might be sold as a slave hythe latter or (later)
revocatus in patroni servitutem, Cod. 4. 10. 1. Lastly, there was the case
noticed in the text. The rule stated in Cod. 7. 16. 6. 10 (‘ liberos privatis
pactis non posse servos fieri certi iuris erat ’) had led to the kind of
fraud referred to in the text as early as Plautus (Pers. i. 3. 58 ; iii. 1);
and by the time of Mucius Scaevola it had become an established
principle os praetorian law that if a free person twenty years of age
collusively allowed himself to be sold as a slave, in the intention of
sharing the price with the vendor, the praetor should ·refuse him the
proclamatio in libertatem or liberalis causa and adjudge him actually a
slave ς this was confirmed by senatusconsulta, Dig. 40. ¹3- 3. (3) A free·
woman might become a slave under the SC. Claudianum, see supr. (4)
Persons condemned to death, to labour in the mines, or to fight with wild
beasts, became servi poenae (Tit. r2. 3 infi), i.e. slaves with no master at
all : this was abolished by Justinian in Nov. 22. 8.

§ 5. For the twofold division of men into liberi and servi Ulpian in
Dig. 1. 1. 4 substitutes one of three classes : ‘liberi, et his contrarium

servi, et tertium genus libertiz’ cf. Cod. 4. 9. 3, Tit. 5. pr. inf. But
