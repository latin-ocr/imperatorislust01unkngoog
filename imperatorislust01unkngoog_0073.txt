Τ HE EARLIER C ODES ΛΝΒ COMPILA TIONS. 61

to speak of the legislation of Justinian, is that of the codices con·
stitutionum, or compilations of imperial ordinanceS‚ which spread them·
selves over about two and a·half centur-ies· The first with which we
arc acquainted is the codex GregorianuS, a collection of constitutions
ioeued from the time, probably, of Hadrian up to Am. 284, and prin·-
cipally rescripts of Septimius Severus and the emperors who succeeded
him. Its exact date is uncertain, but it cannot well be placed earlier
than mn. 2953 its arrangement was based upon that of the current
commentaries on the Edict. Another compilation of the same
character is the codex Hermogenianus, which may be regarded as an
appendix to the foregoing. The oldest constitution which it con-
tained was issued Aa). 290 or 291 3 the great maj0rity of them belong
to Diocletian and Maximian (A. n. 284—305), though seven enacted
by Valens and Valentinian, about Α. n. 365, are also referred to it;
if this is correct, its composition must lie between Ab. 3⁶5 and Aa).
398, but there are civilians who place it many years before the earlier
of these two dateS‚ and accordingly deny that it could have corn·
prised constitutions of Valens and Valentinian. Both of these codices,
so far as we know, were formed by private personS, that is to say,
not under the authority of an imperial commission; they were in
constant use both in the West and in the East‚ and lost their im-
portance in the latter half of the empire only by being absorbed in
his own code by Justinian.

The contents of the so·called ‘ Vatican fragments ' are more mis-
cellaneous. They are portions of a compilation of ' excerpts from
juristic writings and imperial rescripts and edictS, and were first
published in 1823. The author is unknown, but the date os the work
must be between mn. 372 and ΛΑ). 438, for it contains a constitution
issued in the first of these two years, and in the latter the Theodo-
sian code was published. The jurists whose works are most largely
laid under contribution are Papinian (responsa and quaestiones), Ul·
pian (libri ad edictum, etc.) and Paulus (libri ad edictum, sententiae,
responsa, quaestiones, etc.); Celsus, Julian, and Pomponius are also
often cited. The work seems to have had a purely practical pur-
pose, and was arranged in Titles subdivided into rubrics. Seven of
the Titles are extant, relating to the following subjects : (r) ex empto
et vendito; (2) de usufructu 3 (3) de re uxoria et dotibus; (4) de
excusatione; (5) quando donator intelligatur revocasse voluntatem;
(6) de donationibus ad legem Cinciam; (7) de cognitoribus et
procuratoribus, ,
