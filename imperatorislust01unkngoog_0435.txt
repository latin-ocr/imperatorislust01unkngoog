²rit. η] DE EMPTJONE ET VENDJTJONE. 423

de damni iniuriae actione. Emptio tam sub condicione quam 4
pure contrahi potest. sub condicione veluti ‘si Stichus intra
certum diem tibi placuerit, erit tibi emptus aureis tot.’ Loca 5
sacra vel religiosa, item publica, veluti sorum basilicam, frustra
'quis sciens emit, quas tamen si pro privatis vel profanis
deceptus a venditore emerit, habebit actionem ex empto,
quod non habere ei liceat, ut consequatur, ·quod sua interest
deceptum eum non esse. idem iuris est, si hominem liberum

pro servo emerit.

enforceable by two new remedies ; (1) the actio redhibitoria, which lay
only within six months from the date of the contract, and the object of
which was to cancel it and recover the purchase money with interest3
(2) the actio aestimatoria (or quanti minoris), which enabled the vendee
to recover a part of the purchase money proportionate to the defects
discovered, and which could be brought at any time within a year. This
implied warranty and the aedilician actions were extended to sales of
every kind by the jurists after Labe0.

§ 4. Sales ‘ upon approval‚' as we call them, could be effected by either
a suspensive or a resolutive condition. For an instance of the latter cf.
Dig. 18. 5. 6 ‘si convenit ut res quae venit, si intra certum tempus dis-
plicuisset, redderetur, ex empto actio est.² The condition in the text is
suspensive, and there is no contract until the would-be purchaser ex-
presses approval, though if the res is injured or destroyed before by his
fault he is liable in damageS, Dig. 19. 5. 17. 2. Where the condition is
resolutive the sale is regarded as pure facta, though liable to be cancelled

· by the res failing to give satisfaction ; and it will be cancelled even though

the ground of the disapproval be -injury ·to or destruction of the thing oc·
curring without the vendee's fault. Ifno time is fixed for the expression
of approval or disapproval, it must be stated within a reasonable time
ascertained by local or commercia] usage.

§ 5. All things, incorporea] (e. g. iura in re aliena and debts) as well as
corporeal, and universitates no less than res singulae, can be the objects
of a contract of sale, provided they could be the objects of a contract in
general as between the particular partie5‚ except facta, serviceS, and per-
haps coined money. Res extra commercium, if their character is known
to the vendee, are thus excluded (fraud by the vendor is not essential‚ as
might be inferred from the text 3 see Dig. 18. 1. 43 ib. 6. pr. 3 ib. 34. 23
ib. 70), as also are (1) things which already belong to the purchaser (‘ suae
rei emptio non valet' Dig. 18. 1. 16. pr.), unless the possession or usufruct
is vested in some other person, Dig. ib. 34. 4 ; 41. 2. 28 ; (2) things which
are furtivae to the knowledge of both parties, Dig. 18. 1. 34. 35 and (3)
things which are non-existent, unless their future existence ‘is reckoned
upon or at least hoped for. In the sale of ‘ expectations ’ and things not
yet in esse the Romans draw a distinction. An emptio of a ‘res sperata’
