As, under such circumstanceS, instituti not unsrequently refused to accept
unless guaranteed pro rata portione against creditors' claims'and other
expenseS, it became usual for the heir and the partiary legatee to enter
into a contract (stipulationes partis et pro parte), by which the latter
engaged to indemnify the former against liabilities in proportion to the
share which he took in the estate, and the former that he would transfer
to the legatee his sair proportion os the assetS. This system was adopted
where the heir retained his fourth under the SC. Pegasianum. But is he
did not do 50, but transferred the whole hereditaS, the transaction was
regarded as a quasi-sale, and the contract took the form of stipulations
quasi emptae et venditae hereditatis, which the SC. Trebellianum had
thus dispensed with for some dozen years only.

The Sc. Pegasianum, having thus fully protected the heres from being
unfairly burdened with fideicommissa, also disabled him, as is pointed
out at the end of ς 6, from disappointing the expectations os fideicom-
missarii by refusing to accept the inheritance on the ground that the
liabilities exceeded the assetS. Under such circumstances he could be
compelled by the magistrate to accept and transfer, whereby he forfeited
his right to the fourth : his relation to the hereditas was in fact purely
formal and momentary 3 the liabilities attached, as the rights belonged,
to the transferee alone, who alone could sue the debtorS, and be sued
by the creditorS, of the estate: see § 7 ad fin. Consequently‚ if after
such enforced acceptance there was no one to whom the transfer could
be made (e. g. if the intended transseree had died leaving no successor)
the creditors could claim it themselveS, Di g. 36. 1. 1 1. 2. If, aster exercising
his right of compulsion, the fideicommissarius drew back, and refused the
transfer, it was taken in law to have been made (Dig. 36. 1. 44. pr.)‚ and
even though the share of the inheritance actually given to him was only
a fraction, he was bound to take over, as he was entitled to claim, the
whole, Dig. ib. 1. 93 ib. 16. 4, 5. This right of compulsion could never
be exercised by a fideicommissarius of a res singula, or by a legatee:
‘sed in fideicommissariis hereditatibus id provisum est, ut si scriptus
heres nollet adire hereditatem, iussu praetoris adeat et restituat :
quod beneficium his, quibus singulae res per fideicommissum relictae
sunt, non magis tributum est quam legatariis ' Dig. 29· 4. 17.
