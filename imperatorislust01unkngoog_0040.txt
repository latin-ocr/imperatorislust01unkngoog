digenous law os Rome, as contrasted either with the whole ius gen·
tium, or with such part os the latter as was taken up by the praetor
into his edict. Its sources are enumerated in a passage already cited,
as ⁴ leges, plebiscita, senatus consulta, decreta principum, auctoritas
prudentium! Only the first two of these are of practical importance
until the establishment of the empire, but all are explained below or
in the Commentary on Book 1. Title ο. Cicero (Top. 5) adds to
these sources of the civil law three others, viz. res iudicatae, mos
(cf. Inst. i. τι. 9), and aequitas. Usage, as a source os positive law,
will be treated in the passage of the Institutes referred to ¹. The
authority of precedents, expressly recognised by a rescript of Severus,
was established, as we may gather from Cicer0, at a far earlier period.

· ‘ Nam imperator noster Severus rescripsit, consuetudinem aut rerum

perpetuo similiter iudicatarum auctoritatem vim legis obtinere de·
bere' (Callistratus in Dig. 1. 3. 38). By res iudicatae in Roman law
are to be understood those rules of customary law which gained
acceptance by the uniformity of their judicial application to individual
caseS, and which, according to Austin, are the only true customary
law whatsoever ; among them the most important were the prae-
iudicia of the centumviral court. Their importance, however, as a
source of law is so trifling that neither Gaius nor justinian 'mentions
them3 and this is one of the most interesting points of difference
between the English and the Roman system, which Sir Henry Maine
explains by the difference in their early history: ‘ The theoretical
descent of Roman jurisprudence from a code, the theoretical ascrip-
tion of English law to immemorial unwritten tradition, were the chief
reasons why the development of their system differed from the de-
velopment of ours.' By ‘aequitas ' Cicero seems to have meant the
internal, living, intellectual principle which is an element‘ in all law,
and consequently not a distinct source from which a particular kind
os positive law is generated3 his use of the term is popular rather

expressions may be noticed. (1) In some passages ius civile signifies the older
civil law, whatever its speeific source, as contrasted with later enactments which
either (a) partook os the nature os ius gentium (thus in Gaius ii. 197, 8. it is
opposed to the SC. Neronianum), or (b) were based on political rather than on
purely legal considerations (thus in Gaius ii. 206, and Ulp. Reg. ²4· 12. 13. it is
opposed to the lex Papia Poppaea). (α) It is sometimes opposed to the criminal
law (e. g. Cicero in Verrem i. 42, pro Caecina a). (3) In Dig. 1. a. a. 5 and υ
it is used to denote the law made by the Roman jurists, ‘quod sine scripto in sola
prudentium interpretatione consistit.’ (4) It sometimes expresses the ius Quiri·
tium as summed up in the Twelve Tables.
