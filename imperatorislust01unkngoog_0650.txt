638 EXCURS css X.

the head οἱ the formula, after the appointrpent of the iudex, whenc'e
their name praescriptiones, This was frequently the oese when the
defendant's contention was that the action ought not to be tried at
alL- because it would prejudge a ‘ causa maior ’ (praescriptio prae-
iudicii); and the purpose os thus placing the objection in the fore-
ground was to indicate to the iudex that he was first to examine into
its truth or salsehood, and if he found it well-grounded, to suspend
the hearing until it was removed by the decision os the larger suit.
Other objections of the same character were that the action was
beyond the competence of the court (praescriptio sori), or was barred
by lapse os time (praescriptio temporis); and the actual form they
took was the same as that of praescriptiones pro actore (p. 628 supr.),
viz. ea res agatur, etc.: see Gaius iv. 133. The practice of for-
mulating such objections merely as exceptiones had commenced as
early as Cicero (de invent. ii. 20), and Gaius tells us (iv. 133) that in
his time praescriptiones of this kind were entirely obsolete: in speciem
exceptionis deducuntur. The change was materia13 sor now, if the
defence was established, the defendant was entitled to aequitta13
whereas before, when it took the form of a praescriptio, the hearing
was only suspended, and he might be condemned after all.

The proceedings in iure may now be imagined at an end. Their
object was to formally define the issues to be tried in the action ; to
give a legal form to a dispute which had hitherto existed only as a
matter of fact. When this had been done, and the formula finally
drawn up, the magistrate had no more to do; he was said ‘iudicium
dare,’ the ‘ res' was ‘ in iudicium deducta3' iudicium takes the place
of ius. This stage in the proceedingS‚ at which the action passed
from praetor to iudex, or, according to Roman ideaS, at which it first
became an action at all, was called litis contestatio; no longer a
solemn appeal to witnesses‚ but merely a name retained for con-
venience sake from the older system to mark a moment most eventful
sor the partieS, and attended by important consequences which are
described in detail by Mr. Poste ¹.

² Note on Gaius iii. 180. Briefly, the effects of litis contestatio ip the formulary
period are as follow :—

(1) It consumes the plaintiff's right os action: res in iudicium deducta est, and
de eadem re bis experiri non licet. (π) It is in its nature a quasi-contract, and so
(a) ‘novates' the preexisting obligation between the parties; (b) engenders an obli-
gation, binding on them, to abide by the iudicium whatever its result. (3) It inter·
rupts prescription of the right of action. (4) It affeets the amount of the condem·
nation by being supposed to be followed immediately by judgment: see Poste,
p. 450. (5) It converts the objectos the suit into ‘res litigiosa,' and thus makes
