IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES. 315

entitled to evict him if he allowed the condition of the land to dete-
riorate, Nov. 120. 8. From payment of his rent he was exempted
only by complete destruction of the land (Bk. iii. 24. 3 inf„ eod.
4. 66. 3). Shonld he propose to sell hia interest, the dominus had,
within two mentha, a right of pre-emption (ius προτιμήσως) at the
price agreed upon: the person of the alienee had to be approved by
the latter, veho, however, could only refuae his sanction on reasonable
gmnnds. The modes in which emphyteusis arose are identical ¹with
those for the creation οἶ superficies, and the doubt as to the admissi-
bility of usucapio applica to both.

The mention of pignus», the last of the three iura in re aliena which
are not servitndes. makes thie the most convenient place for discussing
the different forms which pledge or mortgage took in Roman law.
The object of pledge is to give a creditor a real security in addition
to the personal security of his debtor. If the creditor relies sor
satisfaction of his debt solely on a general belief in his debtor's ability
and willingness to meet hia liabilities, he contenta himself with a per-
sonal security, and if the debtor's assets prove insufficient, he must
pro tanto be a loser: but if by any meana he obtains rights over some
definite portion of the debtor's property, to which he can resort in
the >event os non-payment, his security is real, ‘ quia expedit ei pignori
potius incumbere quam in personam agere’ Bk. iv. 1. 14 inf. Real
securim in short, is a meana of protecting a creditor against the risk
of the debtor's insolvency: for creditura who are only ‘ personally ⁹
aecured have no rights against the speeific property to which the
‘ really’ secured creditor can resort until the latter has been paid in
full. Beating thia in mind, it is clear that that form of real security
is the most satisfactory which, while it absolutely secures the creditor,
causes the least inconvenience in other ways to the parties concerned.
lt is important to observe how far these conditions respectively are
satisfiet} by the different forma of real security known to the Roman
lawyers, and also how far these themselves belong to the department
of iura in re aliena.

The earliest form was that known aa fiducia, a term which here
bears the same meaning as in connection with deposit, emancipation,
md coemption, the general idea being that of a conveyance under an
agreement of trust, whereby the transferee is laid under an obligation
to deal with the person or property conveyed to him in a particular
manner. The aim of real security was obtained by the debtor'e
conveying specific property (if res mancipi, by mancipation, if nec
mancipi, by in iure cessio) to the creditor, upon terma that the latter
