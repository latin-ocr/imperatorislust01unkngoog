tutes were published, the three distinct bodies of rules relating to one
subject still coexisted side by side: the successor of an intestate might ⁶
base his claim on the Twelve Tables, on the Edict, or on some enact-
ment of the later civil law3 in the second case, it is true, he was not
technically berea, but, as we have already seen, his rights were sub-
stantially identical with those of a civil law successor. Cases were
even still to be found, in which agnatic relationship entitled a claimant
to priority over others who, if cognatiori alone were considered, would
at least take with him pari passu. It was not unnatural that Justinian
should be dissatisfied with his work, and by a Novel issued in the year
A. n. 543 he substituted for the system of succession which has here
been sketched a new scheme based entirely upon blood relationship,
of which an account is given in the notes to Title 9. 9.

Two other modes ‘ quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur,’
though of far less interest and importance than inheritance, are
described in Titles 10 and 1 1. The first of these is the type of adop-
tion known as adrogation. When a person sui iuris gave himself in
adoption to another, his, universitas iuris passed, under the law as
previously settled, to the latter3 but the development of the filius-
familias' proprietary capacity had infringed upon the necessity of this
rule, and justinian, as he hImself remarks, limited the adrogator’s
· right in accordance with the principle which he had already estab-
lished in the second book. The liability of the adrogator sor debts
contracted by the adopted son while sui iuris is treated in the· last
paragraph of the Title. The last remaining form of universal succes-
sion, which was introduced by a constitution of Marcus AureliuS, was
a provision ‘ favore libertatis,' to secure the freedom os slaves who
had been manumitted in a will under which no heres accepted, and

· enabled any one who would give the creditors full security for the

satisfaction os their claims to have the estate adjudged to him, thus
putting it in his power, as quasi heir, to sulfil the intentioris of the
deceased.

Title 12 briefly touches on two universal successions obsolete under
Justinian's legislation ; the one the peculiar form ofbankruptcy execu-
tion known as bonorum emptio —- a subject which is more fully
discussed in a note on the text 3 the other introduced by the SC.
Claudianum, of which we have already read, and which, with its con-
seqnenoes, was repealed by Justinian in person.

From this subject we pass at Title 13 to the consideration of the
important class of res incorporales called obligations. An obligation
is a legal relation between two ascertained persons, in virtue os which
