actio quae vocatur condicti0. Is quoque, qui non debitum l
accepit ab eo qui per errorem solvit, re obligatur: daturque
agenti contra eum propter repetitionem condicticia actio.
nam proinde ei condici potest ‘si paret eum dare oportere’
ac si mutuum accepisset: unde pupillus, si ei sine tutoris
auctoritate non debitum per errorem datum est, non tenetur
indebiti condictione non magis quam mutui datione. sed
haec species obligationis non videtur ex contractu consistere,

whether what passes is dominium, as in mutuum, possession, as in
pignus, or detention, as in commodatum and depositum. The bare
agreement to deliver was by itself not binding ε else the contract would
have been not real, but consensual.

A mutuum (loan for consumption‚ as contrasted with commodatum,
loan for use) exists only if the property passes in what is lent: ‘sinon
fiat tuum, non nascitur obligatio ' Dig. 12. 1. 2. 2 so that as a general
mle no one can lend in this form unless he is owner, Dig. ib. 2. 4, and
has the capacity of alienation, Bk. ii. 8. 2 supr.: cf. Dig. 26. 8. 9. pr. The
chief duty os the borrower is specified in the text, viz. to give back as
much and as good as was lent him: not the same thing, for only those
objects can be thus lent which the commentators call res sungibiles‚ and
the Romans quantitas 3 or, as it is otherwise expressed, they have to be
returned not in specie, but in genere. Unless a date for repayment was
agreed upon either expressly or by implication, it could be demanded at
any time. If interest was part of the bargain, it could not be sued for
under the mutuum itself, owing to the nature of the remedy: the agree-
ment to pay it must be entered into by stipulation, so that it, and the
promise to repay the principal, were distinct contracts. The action on a.
loan of money was called condictio certi, that on any other mutuum con-
dictio triticaria: see the references in the General Index. For the bearing
of the SC. Macedonianum on the law of money loans see Bk. iv. 7. 7 and
notes inf.

§ 1. In Tit. 27. 6 inf. (derived from Gaius in Dig. 44. 7. 5. 3) the person
to whom money not really due is paid by mistake is said to be bound to
return it quasi ex contractu. In Gaius’ time (iii. 91) it had been a moot
point whether a pupillus to whom such a payment had been made
without his guardian's auctoritas was liable to condictio indebiti; perhaps
this was part os the larger question whether a pupillus was bound even'
naturaliter by his unauthorized contracts, Dig. 26. 8. 5, pr. and 1. Gaius
himself was in favour os the affirmative opinion, which on principle seems
right, sor (as Mr. Poste says) condictio was not founded on contract, but
on the fact that a defendant had been without cause enriched at the
expense of the plaintiff.

Condictio indebiti lay only under the following conditions:

(1) What is paid must not really be owed by the one party to the
