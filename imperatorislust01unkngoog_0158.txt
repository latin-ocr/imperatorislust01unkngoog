autem lex ab intestato vocat ad tutelam adgnatos„ non hanc
habet significationem, si omnino non fecerit testamentum is
qui poterat tutores dare, sed si quantum ad tutelam pertinet
intestatus decesserit. quod tunc quoque accidere intellegitur,

adgnationis quidem ius omnibus modis capitis deminutione
plerumque perimitur: nam adgnatio iuris est nornen. cogna-

DE cAP1T1s MINUTIONE.

Est autem capitis deminutio prioris status commutatio.-
eaque tribus modis accidit: nam aut maxima est capitis
deminutio aut minor, quam quidam mediam vocant, aut

exclude cognates wh0, even though per virilis sexus personas coniuncti,
had by capitis deminutio left their (agnatic) family. This last error of
Gaius’ and Justinian's definition is avoided by Ulpian‚ reg. 11. 4, who
adds ‘eiusdem familiae! Agnates, in fact, are persons related to one
another through maleS, whether the relationship be natural, adoptive,
or quasi-adoptive as produced by manus, and between whom no barrier
has been interposed by capitis deminuti03 and agnation is the tie be-
tween two or more persons which is based on the potestas or manus to
which all of them would be subject if the head of the familia were still
alive : see Maine, Ancient Law pp. 146—8. For the reason why the de-
scendants of a woman were not agnates of ber blood relations see on
Tit. 9. 3 supr.

Τὴο praetorian changes in the law os intestate succession (between
which and the tutela legitima there was such an intimate connection)
were not accompanied by corresponding changes in the law of guardian·
ship. By N ov. 118 Justinian revolutionized the former branch of law by
substituting title by cognation for title by agnation, and modified the
law of guardianship in accordance therewith, cognatic relationship alone
in future conferring a claim to tutela legitima.

§a This passage is borne out by Bk. iii. 1. 11 inf. ‘naturalia enim
iura civilis ratio perimere non potest‚'·but (as is observed by Mr. Poste
on Gaius i. 158) is almost completely contradicted by Tit. 16. 6 inf„
which expressly (and truly) says that the two higher kinds of capitis
deminutio destroyed naturalia iura based on cognatio no less than civilia
iura based on adgnati0.
