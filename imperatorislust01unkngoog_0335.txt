· tion· and the animus domini. No one possesses who has not the
exclusive physical power of dealing with an object, coupled with the
intehtion of dealing with it as his own against all the world ; the pre-
sence of these two marks entitles the person ⁴in whom they are united
to the protection of interdicta. This possession, as distinct from
detention, is called in the authorities most frequently possessio simply,
but sometimes also—possessio civilis (e. g. Dig. 4ι. 2. 24 ; ro. 4. 7. r 3
45. 1. 38. 7); Savigny terms it ‘ possessio ad interdicta3 ' we shall
call it uniformly Possession. ·

· In respect of four cases the preceding statement requires a slight
modification. Possession is ascribed in the Digest to the emphyteuta
(22. 1. 25. ι), the pledgee in a pignus (41. 3. 16), the sequester or
stakeholder (16. 3. 17), and ordinarily to the precario rogans (43. 26. 4.
ι), yet in no case can they be said to have the artimus domini, for they
all recognise and respect the dominium of another person. In these
cases, then, sor the animus domini the law allows the substitution ot·
an animus alienam possessionem exercendi3 they are termed by
Savigny cases of derivative or representative possession, and are
clearly distinguishable from those of the agent, borrower, ordinary
bailee, hii-er, usufructuary, and the missus in possessionem (Dig. 41.
a. 3. 23 ; ib. ro. ι), none of whom have more than Detention.

Possession is acquired by the productiori of its two elementa, viz.
corpus or factum (when this alone is present there is detention) and
animus; ⁸, adipiscimur possessionem corpore et anime, neque per se
animo aut per se corpore ’ Dig. 41. 2. 3. 1. The act by which corpuS,
the physical control, is produced, is called usually apprehensiO, or,
where effected with the consent or co—operation of the prior holder,
traditio. Apprehensio os immoveables most commonly takes the
form of actual presence upon the land (Dig. 41. 2. 3. 1), but actual
entry is not necessary if one stand near enough to overlook it all, for
here one’s control over it is as great as if one had actually entered
(Dig. 4ι. 2. 18. 2). Nor, to ‘ apprehend ' moveable& is it strictly
necessary to grasp them with the hand; it is sufficient if the thing
could at any moment be so actually grasped as to give the exclusive
control (Dig. loc. cit. 1. 21); in both cases it is not the nearness, nor
even the presence, of the object which constitutes corpus, but the
capacity ofphysical control to the exclusion of all others 3 thu8‚ aman
has not detention of objects placed in his house, is it is in the occupa-
tion os another, e. g. a lessee.

The animus domini will of course usually precede, as well as
accompany, apprehension. But sometimes it arises later: e. g. a
