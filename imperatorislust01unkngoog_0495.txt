AGENCY.

Tmr question of contractual agency or representation is this: to
what extent, if any, was it possible for B (not being a mere messenger
or ‘ animated letter,’ but a genuine agent, allowed more or' less discre-
tion) to make a contract with C for A, so that (assuming of course
that B discloses the fact of his agency and his principal's name, and
does not exeeed his instructions)

A alone acquires rights against and can sue C?
C acquires·rights against and can sue A only, and
B neither acquires rights, nor incurs liabilities under the contract?

The principle of the old civil law was that the only person who

became entitled or bound under a contract was the person who made

· it, whether he acted for himself or as agent for some third party.

The only exception of any importance arose from the proprietary
incapacity of persons in potestas, manuS, and mancipium: all benefit
arising from contracts made by these vested in their domestic superior,
because it could not vest in them3 so that if A wished to make
a unilateral contract in which he should be creditor through an agent,

' he need only get a filiusfamilias (e. g.) of his own to stipulate;

whether he stipulated for himself or for his paterfamilias was imma-
terial. The operation of this, however, as a form of agency must have
been slender, as the superior could not be bound by the inferior’s
promises, and therefore it was inapplieable to the dispositions of every-
day life, such as sale and hire, all of which are bilateral.

How did the matter stand, if the agent employed was an ‘ extranea
persona?' It has been pointed out, on Bk. iii. 19. 4, that (with a few
exceptions) B could not make a contract with C for A and in A’s
name, so as to entitle the latter against C : and the case in which B
is A's agent is not one of those exceptione.. Consequently, if it is
wished to create an obligation at 211,st is essential that B should first
make the contract suo nomine: to confer any right on A he must
take further measureS, shortly to be noticed. Against this view, how-
ever, Savigny (Systern 1ii. 95 sq.; Oblig. ii. 40 sq.,) followed by Mr.
