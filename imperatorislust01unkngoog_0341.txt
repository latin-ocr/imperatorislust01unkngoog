INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III.

ΙΝ this book the treatment of universal succession is continued, the
first subject considered being the mode in which a person's univer·
sitas iuris devolves on his dying intestate. This falls naturally into
two divisions‚ according as the deceased was free-born or libertus,

Of the devolution os a free-born man’s universitas we have a full
historical account. The first two Tities in the main describe the
classes of persons who succeeded an intestate under the law of the
Twelve Tablesz in the first rank being the sui heredes to the ex-
clusion of all other descendant83 in the second the nearest agnate or
agnates, in preference to ascendants and all other collateral relatives
whatsoever. No portion os the Institutes presents so clearly the
contrast between modern and ancient law, or brings out more vividly
the exclusive regard paid to agnatio relationship in primitive society.
While pointing out' the injustice which this system of succession
entailed upon many classa, especially emancipated children and de-
scendants or collaterals who traced their kinship with the deceased
through a female, Justinian takes occasion to describe briefly the
extent to which a remedy had been supplied by the bonorum possessio
intestati of the Praetor, a subject more explicitly treated in Title 9,
and also various disconnected changes made in the law by earlier
Emperors as well as by himself. To the most sweeping of the
Praetor’s innovations, namely that by which he granted rights of
succession upon intestacy to persons related to the deceased by
cognation alone, though only in subordination to the classes recognised
by the Twelve Tables, the fifth Title is exclusivel‘y devoted3 that
which follows details the mode in which the degrees of this natural
relationship are calculated. The third and fourth Titles deal with
two enactments of the civil law passed in the latter half of the second
century, the Sca. Tertullianum and Orfitianum, which redressed a
wrong arising from the Twelve Tables for which no adequate remedy
had been provided by the praetorian bonorum possessio. The first of
these preferred the mother to many of the agnates of her deceased
children: the second raised a woman's children from the rank of
