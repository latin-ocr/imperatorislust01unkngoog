realized was the claim os another person. This cessio nominum
or actionum, as it was called, though it dispensed with the necessity
of the debtor's assent, was not only rude, but faulty, especially if
made sor valuable consideration„ The appointment of C, as A’s
procurator, was governed by the usual mles of mandatum, and con-
sequently became void (Bk. iii. 26. 9 and 10) if before action brought
either assignor or assignee died, or if the former revoked his com·
mission3 there was no leg-al relation between assignee and debtor
until litis contestatio had been reached in proceedings taken by the
former. At length this was obviated by the assignee’s being allowed
to sue, not in the assignor’s name, but in his own by actio utilis
(Dig. 3. 3. 55, Cod. 4. 15. ult. ς 6. 37. 18), which he was enabled by
gradual changes to do not only where he had been expressly ap·
pointed agent, but also in cases of a mere alienatory disposition.
It is disputed whether- the effect of the change was to make the
assignee sole creditor, or whether, in relation to the debtor, he did
not still legally continue a mere agent, enforcing by action in his own
name the right of another; in other words, whether a genuine assign-
ment, by which the assignee simply and actually stepped into the
shoes of his assignor‚ who simultaneously dropped altogether out of
the matter, was recognized at any time in Roman law. This,
however, is too minute and complicated a question to be entered
upon. ,

For such assignment no form was prescribed. Ι It could be effected
(1) by any expression of intention, unless it was of such a legal cha-
racter as to be invalid unless acoompanied by certain solemnities (e. g.
donati0, p. 224 supr.) 3 (2) by judicial sentence, e. g. in an actio familiae
erciscundae, Dig. 10. 2. 3. If a defendant were ordered to uansfe‘r
a chose in action, the judge might add that unless the order were
obeyed the assignment should be taken to have actually been made3
(3) in pursuance of a general rule os law (cessio legis), e.g. a person
who procures the rescission of a will by querella inofficiosi can
recover legacies paid by the testamentary heir, Dig. 5. 2. 8. 163
19.1.13.25.

The following rules of assignment are deserving of notice, if only
for the close parallelisrn -between some of them and those of English
law:

(1) Until the debtor has received notice of the assignment, he is at
liberty to neat the assignor as his true creditor 3 thus he is released
by payment to him (‘ ille, cuius nomen tibi pignori datum est, nisi ei
cui debuit solvit nondum certior a te de obligatione tua sactuS,
