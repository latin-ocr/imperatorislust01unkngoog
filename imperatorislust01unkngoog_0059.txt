THE EARLIER JURISTS—SABINIANS ἃ* PROCULIANS. 47

having nothing but ‘a beggarly account of scraps and fragments ¹.'
There are points of resemblance which make a compat-ison between the
development of law at Rome by the prudentes and its growth in England
through avast series of judicial decisions‚ both interesting and instructive;
but there is a difference of very great importance between them, which is
this ;—at Rome the jurists were not usually judges, nor were the Judges
usually jur-ists5 and hence it was not with strict reference only to an
actual concrete case that a jurist could make new law, but he could
do this upon a hypothetical set of circumstances submitted to him by
a pupil or any other person; and, as is remarked by Sir Henry
Maine ², ‘ where the data can be multiplied at pleasure, the facilities
for evolving a general rule are immensely increased.' The development
of English case law, on the other hand, has been merely the outcome
of practica] necessity, and from the scientific point of view is open to
many of the objections which have been stated as against it by
Austin ⁸. The Roman jurisprudence owed its perfectiori precisely
to the fact that in it theory and practice were never in a constant
state of antagonism; whereas in England the practica! disregard of
the one in favour of the other, or injudicious efforts at reconciliation,
have often had the effect οῖ at once marring the theory, and pervert-
ing the practice.

As has been observed, the first Roman jurist who can be credited
with a genuine scientific treatment and exposition of the law was
Q. Mucius Scaevola, who ‘ius civile primus constituit generatim in
libros decem et octo redigendo' (Pomponius in Dig. 1. 2. 2. 41).
From another work os his, Liber singularis ὅρων (definitions), there are
four excerpts in the Digest. C. Aquilius Gallus, Cicero’s colleague in
the praetotship, to whom are due the exceptio doli, postumi Aquiliam,
and the Aquilian stipulation (Inst. iii. 29. 2), was Scaevola's most cele-
brated auditor, and himself the teacher of Servius Sulpicius Rufus,
consul nc. 51, whom Cicero calls the first of all juristS, and who in
his discussions of legal questions followed a logical method which
gave a powerful impulse to the scientific treatment of law. Among
the jurists of Cicero's age who composed works on the subject are
Aufidius Namusa, Aulus Ofilius (author of the first commentary on the
edict), Alfenus Vama, C. Trebatius Testa, Aulus CascelliuS, Q. Tuber0,

and Aelius Gallus.
