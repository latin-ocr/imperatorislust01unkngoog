quaeritur, an ei pecunia debeatur, sed an iuraverit. Poenales 12
quoque actiones bene multas ex sua iurisdictione introduxit:
veluti adversus eum qui quid ex albo eius corrupisset: et in
eum qui patronum vel parentem in· ius vocasset, cum id non
impetrasset: item adversus eum, qui vi exemerit eum qui in
ius vocaretur, cuiusve dolo alius exemerit: et alias innume-
rabiles. Praeiudiciales actiones in rem esse videntur, quales 13
sunt, per quas quaeritur, an2 aliquis liber vel an.- libertus sit,
vel de partu agnoscendo. ex quibus fere una illa· legitimam
causam habet, per quam quaeritur, an aliquis liber sit:
ceterae ex ipsius praetoris iurisdictione substantiam capiunt.

could not go: ‘non aliud quaeritur quam an iuratum sit ’ Dig. 12: 2. 5. 2.
The mode in which the oath was used was by the plaintiff demanding of
his adversary in the initial stage of the proceedings (in iure, in the
formulary period) whether he would swear. that the claim.had no founda-
tion3 if he did se, he was protected by the exceptio iurisiurandi from
further litigation ε but if, without being prepared* to go sofar as this, he
challenged the plaintiff to swear to the justice of his claim, and the
latter did se, he was debarred from denying his liability3 if he refused
to discharge it, he could be brought to bay by the actio in facturn re-

· ferred to in the text.

ᾗ 12. The praetor's edicts and orders seem, like the leges (Dion. Halic.
R. A. 3. 36), to have been engraved on tablets of oak, which were then
whitened over and exposed to public view. Subsequently other materials
were used: ‘in albu, vel in charta, vel in alia materia’ Dig. 2. 1. 7. pr.,
but the name album was retained. Albi corruptio is used in a wide
sense: ‘is qui album raserit, corruperit, sustulerit, mutaverit, quidve
aliud propositum edicendi causa turbaverit, extra ordinem punietur’
Paul. sent. rec. 1. 13a. 3. For the action of a patron against his freed·
man sor suing him without first obtaining the praetor's permission (Tit. 16.
3 ins.) see Gaius iv. 46, which also refers to the penal aetio in factum
‘contra eum qui vi exemerit eum qui in ius vocatur : ' for the latter cf.
also Dig. 2. 7. Among the ‘alias innumerabiles' are the actions men·
tioned in Tit. 5 supr., and ξ 25 inf.

ξ 13. For praejudicial actions under the system of formulae see Ex-
cursus X inf. Their object is merely to judicially ascertain facts which
are os legal importance, or the existence os alleged legal relationS, e. g. a
man's status or paternity‚ the amount of a dos-(Gaius iv. 44), whether a
woman is married or not, Dig. 25. 3. 3. 4, whether the provisions of this
or that enactment have been complied with (e. g. the lex Cicereia, Gaius
iii. 123. p. 411 supr.)‚ etc. Hence the name praeiudicia3 the decision
forms or may form the basis of subsequent litigation. As they do not
result in condemnation, but merely in a pronunciati0‚ they are sometimes

said to be iudicia, but not actiones (e. g. Dig. 3. 3. 35. 2) ; Justinian says
