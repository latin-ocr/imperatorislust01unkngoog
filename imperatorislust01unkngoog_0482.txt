470 EXCURSUS VI.

Instances in which this highest degree of diligence was demanded are
those of the commodatarius, Bk. iii. 14. 23 the depositor, the pledgee
in a pignus, ib. 4 ; the vendor, Dig. 18. 6. 3; the hirer (conductor),
Dig. 19. 2. 57, and letter (locator), Cod. 4. 6. 28: the authorized
agent (mandatarius), Cod. 4. 35. 13, and unauthorized agent (negoti-
orum gestor), Bk. iii. 27. 1. ·

(2) In other relations the law was satisfied with 2 less rigid standard:
i.e. a man was required to be only as careful as he was in affairs
which concerned no one but himself, or in which he himself would be
the person primarily injured by carelessness: ‘talem praestare dili·
gentiam qualem in suis rebus adhibere solet 3¹ or, as modern writers
say, he was held answerable only for culpa levis in concrete. This
lower degree of carefulnaes only was demanded from the depositary
(Dig. 16. 3. 32: the contradiction of Bk. iii. 14. 3 is only apparent):
the lender (commodator)‚ Dig. 47. 2. 63. 63 the tutor, Dig. 27. 3. 1.
pr. and curator; pastners (socii) inter se, Dig. 17. 2. 52. 1: ib. ’123
coheirs and colegatees, Dig. 10. 2: 25. 16, and the husband in respect
of the dos, Dig. 23. 3. 17. If one may lay down a general rule, it
would perhaps best be formulated thus: in contr-actual and quasi-
contractual relations the defendant is usually required to show exacta
diligentia, but the burden of proving his negligence is on the plaintiff3
in some of them, however, the defendant is excused if he can prove that
he has shown such diligence and care as he usually displays in the
conduct of his own affairs.

Mr. Poste, in his note on this subject (Gaius pp. 478-481), criti·
cises as unnecessary and complicated the tripartite division into the
diligence (a) of an ordinary man, (b) of a man in his own concerns,
and (c) of the bonus materfamilias, and adopts the two last criteria
only. The result of this is a faulty determination of culpa lata, which
he defines as ‘ the absence of the degree of diligence which a man habi-
tually bestows on his own concerns 3 ’ that this is wrong is clear from
the definition cited above from Dig. 50. 16. ²13· 2. Hence too arises a
practical difficulty: for if we suppose (e. g.) a partner to be less careful
in suis rebus than an ordinary man, and yet to display in societatis
rebus that care which he bestows on his own, how is he to be judged?
He has been guilty of culpa lata according to the definition of the
Digest, and yet on Mr. Poste’s principle he is not answerable.

No test has yet been suggested for determining the degree of dili·
gence required by law in a given relation which is not matred by per-
plexing exceptions. Perhaps the one which covers the greatest number
of instanees is that proposed by Mr. Poste, p. 479 : ‘ the principle
