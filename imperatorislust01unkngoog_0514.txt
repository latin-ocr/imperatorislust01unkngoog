6 Furtum autem fit non solum, cum quis intercipiendi eausa
rem alienam amovet, sed generaliter cum quis alienam rem
invito domino contractat. itaque sive creditor pignore sive is
apud quem res deposita est ea re utatur sive is qui rem
utendam accepit in alium usum eam transferat, quam cuius
gratia ei data est, furtum committit. veluti si quis argentum
utendum acceperit quasi amicos ad cenam invitaturus et id
peregre secum tulerit, aut si quis equum gestandi musa
commodatum sibi longius aliquo duxerit, quod veteres scrip-

7 serunt de e0, quiin aciem equum perduxisset. Placuit tamen
eos, qui rebus commodatis aliter uterentur, quam utendas
acceperint, ita furtum committere, si se intellegant id invito
domino facere eumque si intellexisset non permissurum, ac si
permissurum credant, extra crimen videri: optima sane dis-
tinctione, quia furtum sine affectu furandi non committitur.

8 Sed et si credat aliquis invito domino se rem commodatam
sibi contrectare, domino autem volente id fiat, dicitur furtum

had been capitaliS, Gaius iii. 189 3 if the fur was a free man, he was
flogged, and then addictus to the person he had wronged3 if a slave, he
was flogged and hurled from the Tarpeian rock3 and a thies who resisted
arrest, or who stole by night, might be killed. The ‘asperitas' of this
punishment led to the praetor's substituting the pecuniary penalty
mentioned in the text in all cases, Gaius ib.; that for furtum nec mani·
festum was fixed from the outset by the Twelve Tables. The reason why
the two offences were so differently treated was ‘because the legislator
wished, by the amplitude of the legal remedy offered, to induce the
aggrieved party not to take the law into his own hands and inflict
summary vengeance on the offender' Mr. Poste on Gaius iii. 1793 cf.
Excursus X inf.

ς 6. Intercipere means the appropriation of ownership, quod alienum
est, sibi habere: the illustrations given here fall under (6) p. 499 supr. For
a creditor to sell the pignus against the terms of his contract was no less
thest than using it, Dig. 47. 2. 73. The person ‘qui rem utendam
accepit ³ is the commodatarius.

§ ιἸ. In the corresponding passage of Gaius (iii. 197) sor ‘ sine affectu
furandi ' we read ‘ sine dolo malo,² Sabinus (Gell. 1 1. 18), and perhaps also
Labe0‚ had held that a commodatarius should be held guilty of theft in
this case, if the dominus would not as a fact have consented to his using
the res commodata in the particular way, ‘cum id se invito domino
facere iudicare deberet! But without express knowledge that his per—
mission would not have been given there could be no dolus.
