620 EXCURSUS X.

favour among the Romans. When political authority has at length
obtained a firm footing, the magistrate is gradually preferred by liti·
gants to a citizen arbitrator, perhaps from a conviction os his grene
wisdom and impartiality 3 if he is a king, perhaps too because his

. divine descent is believed to confer-upon him a sense of rig-ht, and a

kind os knowledge, above his merely human fellows. F inally, the
judicial function is recognised as appertaining to the state ; though
the primitive remedies may to some extent survive in all their rude·
nem, 3ηά though the state administration of justice may still more
widely bear traces os the soeial condition which preceded politica!
organisation, still·the natural mode of deeiding a dispute is to go tu
the magistrate, and rules of civil -procedure have begun to assume
consistency. Courts have become established; their mode of action
is prescribed by law; any attempt to evade their authority by recur-
ring to other methods of obtaining satisfaction, save in certain well
defined caseS, is considered a defiance of law, and a breach of the
peace. .

This is -the conditiones the earliest judicial institutions at Rome
of which we have any information. Gaius tells us that the formulary
procedure which was in use in his time had superseded a system of
‘ Statute-ProceSS,' which presents to us all the characteristic seatium
of a nascent judicature. There were but five forms of redress for
wrong, called legis actiones, a name of which two alternative explana-
tions are given by Gaius (iv. 11). Three of these are genuine ae-
tions; the other two are anomalous, for, though called ‘ actiones:
they are clearly ‘ survivals ’ from the older system os sels-tedress and

seem at first sight to have little in common with an action in the

ordinary sense of the word: ‘ they cannot ' (says Sir H. Maine) ‘ be made

to square in any way with our modern conception of an action.¹ One

os these is pignoris capio„ which Gaius (iv. 29) says some refused to

regard as a legis actio at all, among other reasons because of its

extra-judicial character. In point os fact, it is the old practice of

distraint, restricted by the encroachments of a more civilized pro-

cess to certain limited kinds of claims of a public or religious nature,

and even then to be successfully applied only by careful observance

of prescribed forms of speech and action. It could be used by 3

soldier against the tribunus aerarius for arrears of pay ¹, and by the

cavalry in order to procure money for the purchase of a horse and

his corn (aes equestre, aes hordearium); its employment in these

cases was anterior to all records (Gaius iv. 26). By the Twelve Tables
