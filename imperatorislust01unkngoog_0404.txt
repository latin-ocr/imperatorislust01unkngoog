5 contigerit. Loca etiam inseri stipulationi solent, veluti ‘ Car-
thagine dare spondes?’ quae stipulatio licet pure fieri vide-
atur, tamen re ipsa habet tempus iniectum, quo promissor
utatur ad pecuniam Carthagine dandam. et ideo si quis ita
Romae stipuletur ‘ hodie Carthagine dare spondes?’ inutilis

6 erit stipulatio, cum impossibilis sit repromissio, Condi-
ciones, quae ad praeteritum vel ad praesens tempus refe-
runtur, aut statim infirmant obligationem aut omnino non
differunt: veluti ‘ si Titius consul fuit' vel ‘si Maevius vivit,
dare spondes?' narn si ea ita non sunt, nihil valet stipulatio:
sin autem ita se habent, statim valet. quae enim per rerum

naturam certa sunt, non morantur obligationem, licet apud
nos incerta sint.

§ 5. An obligation may possibly be performable only in one place, as
happens osten in connection with immoveable property. In some cases
again (as in the text) the place at which performance should be made is
fixed, either expressly or by implication, by the parties. If this is se,
the debtor is neither bound nor entitled to perform elsewhere, though, if
the action by which the obligation was pursued was bonae fidei (or even
stricti iuris, if demanding a facere) the creditor might sue elsewhere, the
advantage or disadvantage accruing to the defendant being taken into
account in fixing the damageS. When the obligation was to convey
(dare) a definite object or quantitas at a definite place, this could not be
done until after the introduction of the praetorian arbitraria actio ‘ de eo
quod certo loco dari oportet,’ Bk. iv. 6. 31 and 33 inf. ln all other cases
(i.e. where no place was fixed for the performance), the debtor was
entitled to perform wherever he found the creditor, unless the place was
bona fide inconvenient, Dig. 46. 3. 39, and was bound to perform at any
place in which, should he resuse, the creditor actually obtained a jndg-
ment against him. The only exceptions to this are (1) that an heir
cannot be compelled to pay legacies elsewhere than where the greater
part of the inheritance is, Dig. 5. 1. 40. pr., (2) that where a man has to
deliver a specific thing or quantity, he cannot be compelled to do this
elsewhere than where the thing or quantity actually is, unless the creditor
will take the risk and pay the eost os removal, Dig. 4. 1. 38.

§ 6. Where a condition is really satisfied, though upon this point there
may be a subjective uncertainty— e. g. where A, not knowing that Titius
has been consul, promises ten aurei is such is the case, the obligation is
not really conditional, but absolute ; hence legacies subject to such

app‘alrent conditions devolved on the heir os the legatee if the latter out-
live the testator.
