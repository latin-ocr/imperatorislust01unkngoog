628 EXCURSUS X.

never all found together, usually followed in much the same relative
order. We will first examine those inserted in the interest of the
laintiff.

p The DemonstratiO, when found in a formula, immediately follows
the appointrnent of the iudex, and contains the allegation of fact upon
which the plaintiff bases his claim. It invariably begins with ⁶ quod:
‘whereas 3’ e. g. in Gaius iv. 39 ‘ quod Aulus Agerius Numerio Ne—
gidio hominem vendidit 3’ or ⁶ apud Numerium Negidium hominem
deposuit.’ Occasionally the place of the demonstratio is taken by a
praescriptio (pro actore), and sometimes even the latter is prefixed to
or worked into the former3 its use is confined to formulae upon
actions in which the plaintiff is entitled from the defendant to a number
or variety of acts prima facie hanging together, but of which one only,
or at least not all, are claimed in the present action. By the prae-
scriptio, beginning ‘ ea res agatur, let the present trial relate exclusively
to so and soff the plaintiff reserved his right of action upon the other
actS, or those subsequently to fall due, which would otherwise have
been consumed3 it being a presumption of Roman law (capable,
however, of being rebutted by the insertion of a praescriptio in the
formula) that when a man instituted an action, it comprised all his
claims against the defendant, prospective no less than present, so far
at least as they related to the present ground of action, and already
had at least a potential existence. Two examples are given by GaiuS.
In the one, a man to whom an annuity is payable, say, every six
months, sues for a half year’s instalment, using the praescriptio ‘en
res agatur cuius rei dies suit ς’ in the other, the purchaser of an estate,
claiming that it shall be conveyed to him by mancipation, reserves to
himself the right of subsequently demanding its mere traditio by a
praescriptio in the form ‘ ea res agatur de fundo mancipand0.’

The Intentio, which follows the Demonstratio if there be one, is the
part of the formula ‘ qua actor desiderium suum concludit,' in which
the plaintiff either affirms the legal right which he claims against the
defendant, or else states a fact or facts (in which latter case'there is never
a demonstratio) from which the right is to be inserted. It is easily to

reader against confusing the Roman iudex with an English judge. The former was
merely a private citizen, appointed by the praetor after amicable selection by the
parties, to determine certain issues of law and fact in accordance with the evidence
laid before him. Towards the end of the republican period the office, which had
previously been thought an honour, came to be regarded as a burden; and this led
to the institution by Augustus of an ‘album iudicum selectorum‚' from whom the
·judge had to be chosen, and who were compellable to hear cases sent to them by
the-praetor.
