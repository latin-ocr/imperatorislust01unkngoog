IUS RESPONDENDI—CONFLICT OF RESPONSA. 51

bringing it into connection with, and placing it in a subordinate
relation to, the new imperial system. He resolved to make the
function οῖ a jurist, so far as the class was to possess any authority,
· a quasi-public fiinction5 and this was effected by conferi-ing on
certain jurists the ius respondendi, whereby their responsa would be
given, as it were, under imperial sanction: ‘et, ut obiter sciamus, ante
tempora Augusti publice respondendi ius non a principibus dabatur,
sed, qui fiduciam studiorum snorum habebant, consulentibus re-
spondebant. Neque responsa utique signata dabant, sed plerumque
judicibus ipsi scribebant, aut testabantur, qui illos consulebant. Pri·
mus divus Augustus, ut maior iuris auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut
ex auctoritate eins responderent, et ex illo tempore peti hoc pro
beneficio oeepit. Et ideo optimus princeps Hadrianus, cum ab eo
viri praetorii peterent, ut sibi liceret respondere, rescripsit eis, boc
non peti, sed praestari solere, et ideo, si quis fiduciam sui haberet,
delectari se, populo ad respondendum se praepararet ' (Pomponius in
Dig. 1. 2. 2. 49). A form was thus prescribed in which official responsa
should be delivered; they must be written and sealed by their author,
as a precaution against forgery. This practice of investing certain
selected jurists with the ius respondendi was followed by Augustus'
successors, and the prerogative was constantly assuming more and
more the character of a magisteria} function3 thus Gaius (i. ¹1) defines
the prudentes as those ⁶ quibus permissum est iura condere,’ and a
later writer speaks of a jurist being possessed os νομοθετικὴ admisce. It
is‘ not certain what discretion a iudex had under the older system
as to accepting or rejecting the opinion of a prudens whom he
consulted. Now, however, he was obliged tc>¹ decide in accordance
with the advice of any jurist to whom the ius respondendi had been
delegated by the Emperor. Yet among those who were possessed of
this privilege there was no ascertained order of precedence3 how then
was the matter decided if the two parties to an action submitted
discordant responsa? In such a case we must suppose that the
judge was free to choose whichever of the two opinions seemed to
him the more satisfactory. But the difficulty became greater as in
course of time the writings of the privileged jurists, the ‘iuris auc-⁶
tores,’ accumulated3 for these writings were as authoritative as the
responsa, of which in a large degree they consisted (whence Justinian
says (Cod. i. 17. 1. 4) ‘ Antiquorum prudentium, quibus auctoritatem
conscribendarum interpretandarumque legum sacratissimi principes,
praebuerunt’); and it obviously became easier every day for a party
to quote from this or that jurist a view diametrically opposed to the
