viana, quae 'etism hypothecaria vocatur: in personam veluti
quibus de eo agitur, quod aut metus causa. aut dolo malo
factum est, item qua id, quod certo loco promissum est, petitur.
ad exhibendum quoque actio ex arbitrio iudicis pendet. in
his enirn actionibus et ceteris simili-bus permittitur iudici ex
bono e’t aequo secundum cuiusque rei de qua >actum est naturam
aestimare, quemadmodum actori satisfieri oporteat.

period see Excursus Xinf. Under Justinian they may best be described
as actions in which delivery or production of specific property, οι· specific
persor-mance of an agreement, would be decreed‚ the defendant being
condemned in full damages only where execution ef this decree was
impossible. Where the object of the action was restitution, it was
enforced by 'the strong arm of the law3 ‘ qui restituere iussus iudici non
paret, contendens non posse se restituere, si quidem hebeat ran, manu
militari officio iudicis ab eo possessio tmnsfertur, et fructuum dumam
omnisque causae nomine condemnatio fit :- si vero non potest restituere,
si quidem dolo fecit, quominus possit, is quantum adversariis in litem
sine ulla taxatione in infinitum iuraverit² damnandus est: si vero nec
potest restituere, nec dolo fecit quominus possit, non *pluris quam quanti
res est, id est, quanti adversarii interfuit, condemnandus est. Haec sen-
tentia generalis est, et ad omnia, sive interdicta, sive actiones, et sive in
rem sive in personam sint, ex quibus ex arbitratu iudicis quid restituitur,
locum habet! It is not improbable indeed that this direct interventioni
of the state to compel performance os the act demanded occurred when-
ever such performauce was possible (e. g. ‘ exhibere cogendus est ³ Dig. ιο.
4. 8). Interdicis which were restitutoris and exhibitotia, and the actions
depositi, commodnti, locati, and rei uxoriae, when their object was
restitutiorn belonged to this clam of remedy, besides the instenoes given
in the text ς their leading characteristic (spart from the decree of specific
institution, productiori, or personnance) being that, if the defendant is
unable through his own fault to do what is demanded of him, the
damages to be puid are fixed by the plaintiff on oath (insinuandum in
litem).

justinian’s mention of actions demanding payment of money (solutio)
as arbitrariae seems to relate only to the actio de eo quod certo loco, etc„
for which see on Bk. iii. ις. 5 supr. For noxal actions see Tit. 8 inf.

The actio ad exhibendum (for which cf. Tit. 17. 3 inf.) was of a pre-
liminary nature, enabling a plaintiff who could not pursue his right
without the productiori of an object to enforce such productiori upon any
one who was able to make -it ε ‘ exhibere est facere in publico potestatem,
ut ei, qui agat, experiundi sit copia' Dig. io. 4 2, ‘ sciendum est adversus
possessorem hac actione agendum non solum eum, qui civiliter, sed et
eum, qui naturaliter incumbat possessioni ’ ib. 3. 15. The right to which
the action was subsidiary might be in personam, as where a plaintiff
wishes to bring a noxal action, but is not sure of the precise slave
