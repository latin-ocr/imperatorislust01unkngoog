174 EXCURSUS I.

an inserence ε all that is stated in the text is that on a vestal's dying

intestatae she had no heir ab intestato, but that her estate escheated to ’

the treasury‚ and the lawyers were puzzled to explain this z ‘id quo
iure fiat quaeritur! Savigny says the explanation is simple: ⁴ The
reason why a vestal had no intestate heirs was that a woman could
have no suus heres, and that she, in particular, had no agnates to take
in default, because she had left her agnatic family! But if this had
been the true solution, can we believe that the Roman lawyers were
unable to discover it? It would have suggested itself to the veriest
tyro; and it is inconceivable that had this been the case Gellius could
have written the words ‘id quo iure fiat quaerimr! Α better explana-
tion is perhaps to be found in the vestal’s immediate relation to the
gods : her lise had been devoted to their service, and it was only con-
sistent that, on her dying without disposing of her property by will, it
should go to the treasury for sacrificial purposeS. The case of the
Flamen Dialis is exactly parallel: see Gaius iii. 114.

The real fact seems to be that Savigny has been misled by his desire
to establish ‘ a harmonicus system of legal conceptions ’ into adopting
a view against which there is an irresistible weight of textual authority;
he has been overpowered by the word ‘ deminuti0‚’ and by the analogy
which, according to him, there ought to be between deminutio maxima,
media, and minima. Not to speak of the impropriety of arguing
from words in the face of the clearest authority to the contrary, it may
be observed that the jurists agree in describing the essence of capitis
deminutio as a mere change rather than a deterioration of condition:
it is a ‘ status mutatio! It is true that in many cases of capitis de· '
minutio minima (e. g. often in adoption) the agnatio rights which were
lost were more than outbalanced by the rights acquired in the new
family3 but the prominent idea, the feature on which the legal mind is
concentrated, is usually the immediate loss, not the compensator-y
gain. Savigny himself would not deny that there was a capitis demi-
nutio (media) when a Roman citizen lost his civitas, even though he
acquired citizenship in another city whereby he enjoyed sar greater
advantages: and similarly, it is always a capitis deminutio (minima)
if a man loses his previous agnatic rights, even though he acquires in

exchange a perhaps better and more advantageous position in another
family.
