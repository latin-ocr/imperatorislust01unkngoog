Tit. 27.] DE OBLIGATIONIBUS QUASI EX CONTRACTU. 443

que tenetur, ut administrationis rationem reddat. quo casu
ad exactissimam quisque diligentiam compellitur reddere ra-
tionem: nec sufficit talem diligentiam adhibere, qualem suis
rebus adhibere soleret, si modo alius diligentior commodius

torian origin : ‘ ait praetor, si quis negotia alterius, sive quis negotia, quae
cuiusque cum is moritur fuerit, gesserit, iudicium eo nomine dabo. Hoc
edictum necessarium est, quoniam magna utilitas absentium vertitur, ne
indefensi rerum possessionem aut venditionem patiantur, vel pignoris
distractionem, vel poenae committendae actionem, vel iniuria rem suam
amittant’ Dig. 3. 5. 3. 1. To constitute the relation it is necessary that
the business in which the gestor interseres should be some one’s else and
not his own, Dig. ib. 6. 4 (no stress should be laid on ‘absentes' in our
text), and that his interference should not be grounded on any office or
express mandate on which he can sue; if there has been a mandatum,
but no actio mandati lies, he can sue as negotiorum gestor, Dig. ib. ¹9· 2.
His duties are in substance the same as those of a commissioned agent,
for which see on Tit. 26. 8 supr. Those of the dominus negotii are
mainly to indemnify the gestor against all reasonable expenseS‚ with
interest, and to guarantee him against all liabilities. which he has in-
curred on his behalf‚ Dig. ib. 10. pr. ; but the gestor could not enforce
these duties by actio contraria, unless

(1) The dominus had not prohibited his interference, Cod. 2. 19. 24.

(2) His own intention in undertaking the business had been to lay the
other under a legal obligati0n‚ ‘negotia eo animo gerit, ut aliquem sibi
obliget’ Dig. 10. 3. 14. 1 ; so that if his object was his own sole ad-
vantage he could sue the dominus only so sar as the latter had derived
material benefit from his gestio, Dig. 3. 5. 6. 3. If he unwittingly in-
tersered with another person’s business (e. g. as being a bona fide
possessor) he could assert his claim to compensation for reasonable
outlay only by excepti0, unless what he ‘ possessed’ was an hereditaS, in
which case he had an action, Dig. ib. 493 10. 3. 14. 1 ; ib. 29. pr.

(3) The state of the dominus' affairs was such that, except for the
foreign intervention, he would be seriously prejudiced, Dig. 44. 7. 5. pr. 3
if this is sn, the gestor can recover even though the anticipated benefit as
a fact is not realized, or, as it is sometimes put, the negotia need not
have been utiliter gesta, it is enough if they were utiliter coepta, *Dig. 15.
3. 10. 1 ; ib. 12. 2. If the gestio was not thus warranted, but the gestor’s
object was to secure a great advantage sor the dominus, he could recover
only so sar as the advantage actually went, Dig. ib. 11 ς ib. 43.

Subsequent ratification of the gestio by the dominus transforms the
relation into mandatum according to Ulpian in Dig. 42. 1. 60, while
Scaevola in Dig. 3. 5. 9 says that its character remains unaltered. The
solution of the antinomy is probably that after ratification the gestor can
treat the dominus as mandator, but the latter (ratification being merely a
unilateral act) is not entitled to treat the former as mandatarius·
