owner must in many cases have caused no small inconvenience, and
detracted from the valne of this form of security. Of course the
debtor was entitled to any surplus of the purchase money after pay-
ment of the debr.

The latest and most refined form of pledge is hypotheca, in which
there was no conveyance of either ownership or possessiom it was
effected by a bare sormless agreement between the debtor and creditor,
that certain specific property of the former should be liable in tull
for his debt to the latter, who should be entitled to sell in defanlt of
payment within a prescribed time: ⁸ contrahitur hypotheca per pactum
conventum, cum quis paciscatur, ut ren eius propter aliquam obliga*
tionem sint hypothecae nomine obligatae: nec ad rem pertinet,
quibus fit verbis'v Dig. πο. r. 4. Such an agreement, in itself, was
imperative to create rights either real or personali it was, however,
enforced by the praetor, who treated the right of sale as a insin re
aliena, of which the creditor could not be deprived by any subsequent
act os the debtor, and which he could successfully assert (by remedies
of his own introduc-tion) against any other person whatsoever, whether
the creditor, his successor, alienee, or trustee in bankruptcy. The
steps by which this praeton‘an innovation reached its fun development
are these. lt was first introduced in the joi-nt interest of landlord -
and tenant farmer, in order to enable the latter to pledge his sanning
stoclt as security sor his rent, a purpose for which pignus was not
conveniently applicable: subsequently it came to be recognised as a
universal mode of pledge, of use between debtors and creditore of
every kind, though the rights of the latter, in cases other than that of
landlord and tenant, were protected by remedles differ-ing slightly in
form and name from those then employed: sor these, and the relation
between them, reference should be made to Bk. iv. 6. 7, ib. 15. 3 inf„
and the notes on both passages.

Hypotheca possessed great advantages over the earlier forms of
pledge, of which fiducia was quite obsolete in the time of justinian.
The pledgor was never deprived of the use and possession of his
property, and yet the creditor was absolutely secui-ed. The class os
pledgable objects was largely augmented: money could now be lent
on the security of things not yet in existence, e. g. future crops and
expectations (⁶ et quae nondum sunt, sutura tamen sunt, hypothecae
dari possunt, ut fructus pendentes, partus ancillae, fetus pecorum ’
Dig. πο. ι. 15), or of mere incorporeal rights, real and personal
(Dig. ib. 9. ις ib. ιι. 2; Dig. ¹3· 7. 18. pn). Moreover it beoeme
possible to create a general mortgage, which was done by stamte in
