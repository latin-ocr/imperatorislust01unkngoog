EXCURSUS IL

IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES.

Smarrcus is a real (Dig. 30. 86. 4) right of praetorian origin to
a building or part of one, either in perpetuity or for a very extended
term, without any right to the soil upon which it stands: it is a ius
in re aliena because ⁶ superficies solo cedit ; ' the house is properly
owned by the owner of the soil 2 ‘ superficiarias aedes appellamus, quae
in conducto solo positae sunt, quarum proprietas et civili et naturali
iure eius est, cuius et solum' Dig. 43. 18. 2. The modes in which
it could arise are—(1) contract, whether it took the form of gift, sale
(Dig. 43. 18. 1. 1), hire (the annual rent being called solarium), or
permissive building upon land of the state (Dig. 43. 8. 2. 17), or a
private person; (2) legacy3 (3) judicial decree. Whether it could be
acquired by usucapio is much disputed: see Dig. 6. 2. 12. 3; 41. 3.
26. Superficies was alienable inter vivos or by will (Dig. 43. 18. 7.
9), was hei-itable, and could be made the subject of a pledge or
servitude, Dig. ib. 1. 6 and 7, ib. 9. For the protection of his right
the superficiarius could bring in their ‘ utilis’ form all the actions
available to the dominus—rei vindicatio, negatoria, confessoria, and
Publiciana, Dig. ib. 1. 1. 3. 6 ; Dig. 6. 1. 73. 1, and he had a special
interdict de superficie analogous in operation to uti possidetis». That
he technically ⁴ possessed ' the building seems to be proved by his
ability to bring directly the interdicts de vi and de precari0, Dig. 43.

Emphyteusis may be traced back to the agri vectigales, large tracts
os grazing land in Italy belonging to the state or the smaller civitates
and municipia, but held and enjoyed by private persons subject to the
payment of a perpetual rent (vectigal), or let out upon lease for very
long terms of years. The interest of such occupiers received a ‘ real ’
character from the action of the praetor, who protected their pos-
session (Dig. 2. 8. 15. 1) by interdicte, and by a utilis actio in rem
(aetio vectigalis, Dig. 39. 2. 15. 26) available even against the lessor
himself when non-payment of rent was not alleged3 ‘ agri civitatum
