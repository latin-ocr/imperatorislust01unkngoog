ratiO. But among the peoples which composed the Eastern Empire,
and which were Roman in name only, it was inevitable that the
universal should gain the preponderance over the particular jural
element, as more favourable to the survival os the legal system beyond
the life of the individual nation3 the part which was ‘ civitatis pro-
prium ' and strictly national could not fail to decay and gradually
disappear. Old legal dispositionS, such as mancipatio and in iure
cessio, were practically superseded by free forms peculiar to no single
nation, and simultaneously the distinctions of cives, Latini, and pere-
grini ceased to have any real meaning, even if they were still oc-
casionally to be found3 thus the old separation of ius civile and ius
gentium rapidly tended to disappear by the former becoming ab-
sorbed in and swallowed rup by the latter. Secondly, it is to be
observed that Constantine had formally made Christianity the religion
of the empire which he ruled, and the effects of this began to show
themselves at once in the field of private law. There was thus in·
fused into both legislation and judicamre the spirit of a higher equity
and a divinet justice than ‘had been familiar to the classical jur-ists,
which left its traces during this period on many of the rules relating
to slavery‚ colonatus, marriage, concubinage, and patria potestas.
Justinian himself legislated openly in favour of the Church3 for ex-
amples of this reference may be made 'to the index to the text '
(s, v. ⁶ Church ’). Lastly, the constitutional changes which have
been briefly noticed produced modifications in private law through
the revolution which they effected in judicature, and consequently
in civil procedure, and which will be treated in a later part of this
book.

The legislative authority by which the legal changes thus generally
described were introduced requires some notice. The old magistrates

of the populus had now -formally been transformed into imperial
officiale„ and we can hardly believe that the latter could have deemed
themselves competent to exercise the praetor’s function of hannonis-
ing the ‘ strictum ius ’ with the ‘ius aequum' by their own independent
action. ‘ Ex abundanti cautela,' however, Constantine issued a con-
stitution expressly forbidding them to attempt any such task: ‘inter

aequitatem iusque interpositam interpretationem nobis solis et oportet
et licet inspicere'(Constantine in Cod 1. 14. ι). Νοι· is it to be ex-

·pected that, under such conditions as those of the Eastern Empire,

new law could be begotten by usage. Usage or custom, so far as it
is fitted to become law, is grounded upon a common apprehension
os an unwritten mle, upon a common conviction that so and so is
