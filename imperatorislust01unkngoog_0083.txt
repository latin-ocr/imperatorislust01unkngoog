LEGAL EDUCATION—THE REVISED CODE. 71

adopted in Book iii. Title 10. Ownership and iura in re aliena are
compr-ised in Book ii. Titles 1 to 93 possession is touched upon in-
cidentally only, in connection with usucapion (Book ii. Title 6) and
interdicts (Book iv. Title 15). obligations», under the heads of con-
tract and quasi-contram, delict and quasi-delict, occupy Book iii.
Title 13 to Book iv. Title 53 and inheritanee, testate and intestate,
with the cognate topics of legacy and fidei commissum, is the subject
of Book ii. Title ro to Book iii. Title 9. The consideration of the

arrangement adopted by Justinian himself after Gaius is reserved for ·

the introductions to the separate books in which too the reader’s
attention will be called to the chief particulars in which the law of
justinian had advanced upon that of Gaius, or in which the rules
stated by the latter had become obsolete, and thus a mere matter
of antiquarian learning, in the age of the former.

The Institutes were published on Nov. 21, Aa). 533, with statutory
force, along with the Digest, from Dec. 3oth of the same year. At the
same time Justinian fixed the system of study to bein future followed in
tbe public schools of law. The course was to occupy five years The
first was to be devoted to the Institutes and the first four books (wara)
of the Digest3 the second, to the parts of the latter relating to iudicia
and res creditae (Books 5-19)‚ and also to certain portions of later
books dealing with the proprietary relations of husband and wife,
guardian and ward, and testaments and legacies. In the third year
Books 20—22 of the Digest were to be studied, and also certain por·
tions to be gone over again which had been already read in the pre·
ceding year. These were to be followed, in the fourth year, by the
parts of Books 20-36 which had not already engaged the student's
attention. The subjects prescribed for the last year of the course

*were Books 37-50 of the Digest, and the Code; these were read

privately‚ so that the subject-matter of the professorial lectores, which
spread themselves over the first four yearS‚ was the Institutes and the
first thirty-six books of the Digest.

Justinian’s design had been to embraoe in his three authoritative
works every jot and tittle of positive law. It was transparenh however,
as things stood at the end of As). 533, that this obJect had not been
fully attained. The Digest and the InstituteS, from the point of view of
the legal reformet of that epoch, left little to be desired3 but it was at
once perceived that the Code of mn. 529 was sar from complete ; the
great majority of Justinian⁹s own constitutions had been issued subse-
quently to its promulgation, and Tribonian, who had not been president,
but merely an ordinary member of the commission which had compiled
