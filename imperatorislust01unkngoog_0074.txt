senate of his resolution to codisy the constitutions of Constantine Ι
(Λα). 306—337) and all his successors by means of a commission of
nine persons: ‘ Ad similitudinem Gregoriani atque Hermogeniani
codicis cunctas colligi constitutiones decernimus, quas Constantinus
inclytus et post eum divi principes nosque tulimus, edictorum viribus
aut sacra generalitate subnixas ' (Cod. Theod. 1. 1. 5). Nothing, how-
ever, was done till mn. 435, when a fresh commission of sixteen per-
sons was appointed for the purpose, with power to make alterations
in individual constitutions, The result was the Theodosian code, pro-
mulgated in February Λα). 438, with statutory force from and after the
commencement of mn. 439, as the only authority for the ‘ius principale,’
or imperial legislation, from Constantine 1 to that date. It consisted
of sixteen book8‚ arranged separately in Tities and rubr-ies, and the
constitutions in each Title were placed in chronological order. The
first five books were arranged on the plan of the commentaries on the
Edict, and contained most of the enactments relating to private law.
The sixth to the eighth books consist principally of constitutional
and administrative ordinances; the ninth is criminal law; the tenth
and eleventh relate to the financial system, and in part to procedure;
the twelfth to the fifteenth, to the constitution and administration of
towns and other corporations, and the sixteenth contains the consti-
tutions which deal with the church and the ecclesiastical system in
general. This code was accepted in the West as well as in the East,
and partly thuS‚ partly by the ‘law of Citations ’ of twelve years' earlier
date, uniformity of law was secured throughout the two halves oi the
empire. Precautions were also taken against subsequent divergence:
the two governments agreed that constitutions which either might
find occasion to make should be communicated by the one to the other,
and subject to revision by mutual consent be published by both legis-
latures; in default of this procedure they should have no universal
validity. ·In contradistinction to the code, such single enactrnents
were called novellae leges or novels3 a number of them were issued by
Theodosius, Am. 448, and confirmed by Valentinian 111 in the West
in the following year. The joint style of enactrnent was actually
followed till Am. 455, and there are several collections of novels which
belong to this period. From Μ). 455 the tie between the two empires
was greatly weakened, though Anthemius (Aa). 467-472) published
in the West an enactrnent issued in the East by Leo: formally, how-
ever, the connection was maintained, so that the new constitutions still
bore the names of both emperors, though the place of their issue
or the province of the magistrates to whom they were addressed
