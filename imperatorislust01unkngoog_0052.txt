ephemeral character of the ius praetorium that the ius civile always
preserved its distinctness and its separate existence.

The political changes which took place in the years immediately
succeeding the death of Julius Caesar are not unii-equently misunder-
stood. It has been usual to speak of ‘the establishment of the
empirc‚' and thence to infer that the form of constitution was revolu-
tionised‚ and an open despotism suddenly substituted for the free
Republic with which the Romans had now for centuries been familiar.
The real fact is that sormally the constitution remained republican
under and even long after Augustus3 the only outward change has
been not inappropriately described as the addition to the old mag-is-
tracies of a new one, which was held for life, and whose holder was
·invested with an authority far larger, because more compact, than that
of all the old magistrates together. On Augustus were conserred,
sometimes for life, sometimes sor shorter periods, but always to be
renewed, the tribunicia potestaS, the proconsulare imperium, the prae·
sectura morum, the supreme pontificate, and in fact all the highest
offices of state: but in each of these capacities he acted merely as a
magistrate of the Republic, whose outward forms he was studious to
observe. Hence, according to the theory of the constitution, the
supreme power continued to reside in the populus Romanus, and was
exercised‚ as before, in the two comitia for elective and legislative
purposes. Augustus himself voted among the tribes like any other
citizen, and the theoretica! sovereignty of the people remained intact
until the accession of Constantine.

The legislation of the early empire accordingly proceeded at first in
the same manner as it had been accustomed. Leges are still enacted
in the comitia, though usually introduced by the emperor in person, and
if by some other magistrate, always with his sanction; sor his tribu-
nicia potestas enabled him to veto any project which did not meet with
bis approval. GaiuS, who belongs to the middle of the second century,
speaks of this form of enactment as still potentially subsisting: ‘lex est,
quod populus iubet atque constituit ’ (i. 3). But towards the end of the
first century legislation by the populus was becoming rare, and the last
lex of which we have informationis an agrarian law of Nerva (Aa). 96-

senate endured longer. This had originated partly in its old probouleu-
tic ftinction8‚ partly in its relation to the administration. In connection
w'ith the latter, it would seem that even under the Republic its rights
had practically been admitted of regulating the government of the
provinces, maintaining religion, suspending or repealing laws in cases
