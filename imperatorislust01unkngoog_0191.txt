INTRODUCTION To BOOK II. 179

necessary qualifications of the last, and the modes in which they
can accept the inheritance, follow in Title 19, which also contains a
reference to the vast revolution effected in the character of heres by
Justinian's own introduction of the ‘ inventory.’ Legacies are treated
at length in Titles 2o and 2 r, and the successive limitations placed
upon their amount in Title 22. The last three Titles are occupied
with the subject of fideicommissa, trust successions and bequestS,
the legislation relating to them, and codicilli, a form of disposition
resembling a will, but incapable of directly passing the deceased’s
universitas iuris, and employed for the purpose of creating fidei·
commissa, or of adding to or modifying a previously executed
testament.

No small amount of criticism has been passed upon the grouping
together in one department of a legal system of the topics which are
comprised under the ius quod ad res pertinet, and which, we may
truly say, would not be co-ordinated upon any other principle of
classification. The most solid objection is the inclusion of the law
of Inheritance and that of obligations in the same division with that
of property and other real rightS. The place of the first is due to its
character as one of the modes of universal succession, among which
it ranks with adrogation, bonorum addictio libertatis causa, and (in
Gaius) conventio in manum, hereditatis in iure cessi0, and venditio
bonorum. Through this false idea of proportion the importance of
Testamentary and Intestate succession, as an independent branch of
law, is altogether obscured: moreover, as Savigny has remarked,
these modes ‘ quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur ' are ex-
clusively regarded as titles to rightS‚ whereas they are equally sources
of obligations. Accordingly, the German jurist8‚ in their systematic
treatises on Roman law, here abandon the Roman classification, and
make Inheritance one of their main divisions, instead of subordinating
it to that between titles to res singulae, and titles to universitates.

Why obligations are ‘ res' has been already pointed out. When an
obligatio is said to be a res, the activ'e, or creditor-’s side of the rela-
tion is intended. The promisee in a contract, unless the promise is
performed, and the plaintiff in an action on delict, have the power of
recovering damages by action; this partial control over another’s
freedom of action is money’s worth, and falls under the category of
property, in the wide sense in which the term has been used above.
An even more intimate point of contact between the law of owner-
ship and the law of obligations may be found in the ultimate purpose
of the largest and most important class of the latter, viz. the creation
