plerumque efficiunt, ut minus quisque consequatur, quam ei
debentur: namque ex bono et aequo, habita ratione eius,
quod invicem actorem ex eadem causa praestare oporteret,
in reliquum eum cum quo actum est condemnaret, sicut iam

40 dictum est. Eum quoque, qui creditoribus suis bonis cessit,
si postea aliquid adquisierit, quod idoneum emolumentum
habeat, ex integro in id quod facere potest creditores cum
eo experiuntur: inhumanum enim erat spoliatum fortunis suis
in solidum damnari.

QUOD CUM Eo QUI IN ALIENA POTESTATE EST
NEGOTIUM GESTUM ESSE DICITUR.

Quia tamen superius mentionem habuimus de actione,
quae in peculium filiorum familias servorumque agitur: opus
est, ut de hac actione et de ceteris, quae eorundem nomine in
parentes dominosve dari solent, diligentius admoneamus.
et quia, sive cum servis negotium gestum sit sive cum his,
qui in potestate parentis sunt, sere eadem iura servantur, ne
verbosa fiat disputatiO, dirigamus sermonem in personam servi
dominique, idem intellecturi de liberis quoque et parentibus,
quorum in potestate sunt. nam si quid in his proprie ob·
servetur, separatim ostendimus·

‘ne VII. The rule ol' the civil law, already more than once alluded
to, was that in no case could any liability attach to a man‘ upon the
contracte or quasi-contracts made by those in his power, whether slaves or
children: ‘melior condicio nostra per servos fieri potest, deterior fieri
non potest ³ Dig. 50. 17. ι 33 ; cf. Tit. 6. ιιο supr. The manifest injustice
of this in concrete cases led to a praetorian change, by which one with
whom a slave contracted, and who previously had no remedy against
any one, was enabled‚ under certain circumstanceS, to sue the master, οι·
with whom a filiusfamilias contracted could sue the father in preference
to the son, against whom of course he had always had his remedy.
The extent to which the pater or dominus was thus made ansverable
varied according to the circumstances of the case. In some cases he
became liable to the creditor in solidum, as where he had, either ex·
pressly or by implication, directed or subsequently adopted the conuacn
in others his obligation was not coextensive with that of the son, m
where he knew nothing of the transaction, and had derived no persona!
