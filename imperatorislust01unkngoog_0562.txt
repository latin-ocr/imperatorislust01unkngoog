550 [ΝΕ TITUTJONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lm- nr.

divae memoriae loquitur constitutio: sin autem quantitate vel
alio modo plus fuerit petitum, omne, si quid sorte damnum ex

semion, was an equitable remedy introduced by the praetor through
the edict, which in the formulary period had been perhaps the most
⁴ striking example os his extraordinaria cognitio. Its fonction had been
the rescission, in this or that concrete case, os rights and duties multing
from the operation of the ordinary law, because under the special cir·
cumstances equity so required, exactly as equity in England gave relies,
for instance, against mistake‚ when law afforded no remedy whatever.
And this rescission was effected by the direct and immediate action of
the magistrate ; it was an exercise of his imperium, not of his iurisdictio :
in integrum restitutio in its proper sense being thus distinguished from
analogous cases in which a restoration occurred either ipso iure (as in
postliminium) or by the remedia! process of the ordinary law.

The conditions under which in integrum restitutio could be applied for
are aa follow ε

(1) The applicant must have suffered a prejudiee (laesio) stom the
operation of law, which may be lucrum cessans no less than damnum
incidens, Dig. 44 7. 6 ; 4. 6. 27, but which need not be strictly proprietary,
Dig. 4 4. 3. 63 for examples see notes on §§ 4 and 5 supr„ Bk. ii. ι 5. ς
supr„ Gaius iv. 57. On the principle ‘de minimis non curat lex' it
seems also to have been requisite that the laesio should not be merely
trivial.

(2) The mere existence of a laesio in itself is insufficient3 there must
also be a ground (iusta causa) upon which the application is based.
These are six in number: ‘ integri restitutionem praetor tribuit ex his
causis quae per metum, dolum, et status permutationem, et iustum
errorem, et absentiam necessariam, et infirmitatem aetatis gesta esse
dicuntur’ Paul. sent. ree. 1. 7. 2 ; cf. Dig. 4. 1. 1.

The restitutio of a minor (i. e. person under twenty-five years of age)
was independeng if he were also impubeS, is his guardian’s auctoritas
having been given to the disposition against which he appealed‚ Cod. 5.
71. 1 1, except where it was payment to him of a debt, Dig. 4. 4. 7. 2 ; and
under exceptional circumstances he could not obtain restitutio at all, e. g.
where he had represented himself as of fun age, Cod. 2. 45. 1 ; where
the person against whom he claimed it was also a minor, Dig. 4. 4. 1 1. 6 3
and where he had contracted a money ioan at his father's order, Dig.
ib. 3. 4.

Upon any of the remaining five causae a person of full age could get
himself restitutus no less than a minor.

In integrum restitutio was not the only form of relies obtainable
where one had been induced to make a disposition by intimidation or
fraud. Dolus had always been a sufficient desence in a bonae‘ fidei action,
and it was made pleadable (in the form of an exceptio) to actions stricti
iuris by a praetor called Cassius, Dig. 44. 4. 4. 33. ln ac. 71 a praetor
named Octavius introduced the actio and exceptio quod metus causa,
and finally, five years later, Gallus Aquilius added the actio doli.
