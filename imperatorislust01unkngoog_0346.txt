334 INTRODUCTION To BOOK III.

Roman Law3 alternatives are soon tolerated sor the old sacramental
termS, which none could use but Roman citizens, and thus peregrini
are enabled to avail themselves of this universally applicable contract
form; the question and answer are allowed to be expressed in other
languages than Latin, and the strict and liter-al correspondence between
them is no longer regarded as indispensable; finally, that they should
be oral, and so require the presence of the partieS, is found to be au
inconvenient and unnecessary condition, and the original solemnities
of stipulation have dwindled into a written memorandum of a promise
fictitiously represented as having been made in answer to a preceding
question. Some minor matters, such as the qualification of such
promises by time and conditionS, and the use of penalties under
many circumstances, are touched upon in the same‘ Title. Joint and
several liability, or as the modern civilians term it, Correality or
Solidarity‚ is briefly noticed in Title 1 6, because whenever it arose ex
contractu it usually took the form of stipulation. In Title 17 we have
a statement os the effect of promises made by stipulation to a slave:
a subject treated in relation to obligations generally, and to persons in
patria as well as dominica potestas in Title 28. Title 18 relates to a
classification of stipulations according as they are based upon genuine
consent, or are forced upon a party by a judge or magistrate, and so
reminds the reader of the traditional division os contracts in English
law into ‘ contracts os record ' and contracts in the ordinary sense of
the term. This is followed in Title 19 by an ill-arranged exposition
· of circumstances which affect the validity of contracts in general, and
of stipulations in particular, such as illegality, impossibility, insancy,
and weakness of intellect 3 and here too we have a precise statement
of the jural maxim that an obligation is a tie between ascertained
partim, incapable of conferring rights or imposing liabilities on others
who are not parties to it themselves, and Justinian’s own repeal of
some previously existing rules invalidating stipulations‚ but out of
harmony with the modern principle that ‘ consent is the essence of
contract? Title 20 relates to fideiussio, a form os suretyship effected
by stipulation3 other modes in which this important relation could be
established are described in the notes to this Title and Title 26. Title
21, professedly on litera] contract, tells us little more than that literal
contract in the true sense (expensilatio) had long been obsolete, though
it also touches a subject upon which more is said in Excursus VIII inf.

tain a very full treatment of the important class of contracts called
consensual. In the first, their characteristic featureS, as contrasted
