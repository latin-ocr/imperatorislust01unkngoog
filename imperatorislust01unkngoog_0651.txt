EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 639

Of the proceedings in iudicio Gaius gives us no information; they
consisted, of course, of evidence and argument, and may be passed
over in favour of matters of which we have more accurate knowledge.
Assuming, however, that they terminate in a sententia sor the plaintiff
(condemnatio), two new questions present themselves, Firstly‚ is the
judgrnent final? or is there any system of appeal? And, secondly,
how is the defendant compelled to pay the money in which he has
been condemned? in other words, what are the proceedings in a
Roman execution? “

The strictly co-ordinate authority of the ‘ magistratus maiores ' in
republican Rome excluded the possibility of a true appellate juris-
diction in the pre-imperial period. At that time, in fact, the sententia
of a iudex did not admit of revocation or alteration save by the
process of in integrum restitutio (note on Bk. iv. 6. 33), though it must
be remembered that judgment in an ordinary action was not abso—
lutely fina13 for the defendant, who was presumptively condemnatuS‚
could contest its validity by refusing to pay the sum in which he had
been condemned, and· defending himself, at the risk of condemnatio
in duplum, against the actio iudicati brought for its recovery. This,
however, was not an appeal, which implies the rehearing of the suit
by a higher tribunal. With the fall of the Republic a regular appel-
late jurisdiction was rapidly developed, and the privilege os ‘ appealing
unto Caesar ’ was soon understood to be common to citizens of
Rome all over the empire. Under Augustus the praefectus urbi was
judge of appeal for Rome, and a vir consularis„ though sitting in
the capital, bore the same relation to each of the provinces. Nero
invested the Senate with a supreme appellate jurisdiction co-ordinate
with his own, and by the time of M. Aurelius the right had been
established of appealing from the sententia of a iudex to the magis-
trate who appointed him. Thus the tribunals had gradually arranged
themselves in a definite series of higher and lower instance, and a suit
might be carried from iudex to Emperor through the appointing
municipal magistrate, the praetor or praeses and the praefectus urbi
or praetorio in succession. Τὴε procedure on appeal was that which
will shortly be described as ⁸ extraordinaria,' dispensing, in its com-
mencement, with the ordinary institution by formula, and terminating
in a decretum, not a sententia3 definite periods of time were pre·
scribed within which the appeal must be lodged, and its various
stages completed. A powerful check on rash appeals was the

its alienation unlawful pendente lite, Gaius iv. 117. (6) It prevents any subsequeut
change in the parties without complete reconstruction of the formula (Translatio).
