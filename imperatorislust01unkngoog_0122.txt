QUI EX QUIBUS CAUSIS MANUMITTERE NON POSSUNT.

Non tamen cuicumque volenti manumittere licet. narn is
qui in fraudem creditorum manumittit nihil agit, quia lex
lAelia Sentia impedit libertatem. Licet autem domine, qui
solvendo non est, testamento servum suum cum libertate
heredem instituere, ut fiat liber heresque ei solus et neces-
sariuS, si modo nemo alius ex eo testamento heres extiterit,
aut quia nemo heres scriptus sit, aut quia is qui scriptus est
qualibet ex causa heres non extiterit. idque eadem lege
Aelia Sentia provisum est et recte: valde enim prospiciendum
erat, ut egentes homineS, quibus alius heres extaturus non
esset, vel servum suum necessarium heredem habeant, qui
satisfacturus esset creditoribus, aut hoc eo non faciente credi-

sorbade them to live within one hundred miles os Rome under penalty
of becoming slaves again without possibility of a subsequent manumis-
sion ; and their property on decease went to their patron, Gaius iii. 74-
76. This dediticia libertas was practically obsolete before Justinian
(‘ necin usu esse reperimus ² Cod. 7. 5), and was formally abolished by him3
as is stated in this section. (2) It placed restrictions on manumissions
by masters less than twenty yoers of age, Tit. 6. 4 inf. 3 and also (3) pro-
vided that no slave under thirty years of age should be enfranchised
so as to become a civis libertus unless the manumission were by vin·
dicta, and an adequate motive were proved before a council at Rome,
and in the provinces before a body of twenty recuperatores; Gaius
i. 18-20. This provision was repealed by Justinian ; see this paragraph,
ad fin. (4) It invalidated manumissions in fraud os creditors ; see Tit. 6
pr. inf.

It was said above that a Latinus could in certain ways become a
civis ς there were also modes in which a libertus could become ingenuus,
one of which, operative only under the old law, has been noticed in the
note on § 1 supr. Ingenuitas, however, could be conferred by imperial
grant (‘ natalibus restitui' Dig. 40. 11. 2); and by the acquisition from
the emperor of the ‘ius aureorum anulorum ’ a freedman became in-
genuus during his lifetime‚ but could not prejudice his patron’s rights
os succession3 Dig. 38. 2. 3. pr., fragm. Vat. 226, Dig. 40. 10. 6. By
Nov. 78. 1 and 2 Justinian bestowed the ius anulorum on all freed·
men and freedwomen whatsoever: ‘ si quis manumittens servum aut
ancillam suam . . . qui libertatem acceperit, babebit et aureorum anu·
lorum et regenerationis ins) ᾗ
