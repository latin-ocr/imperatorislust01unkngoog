EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 615

the establishment of a regular judicature 3 the injured person, with
his kinsmen or dependents, made a foray against the wrongdoer, and
swept away his cattle, and with them, perhaps, his wife and children,
or he threatened him with supernatural penalties by ⁴ sasting ' upon
him, 'as in the East even at the present day 3 or, finally, he reduced
his adversary to servitude, or took his lise. The idea of such a
procedure was not compensation, but punishment ς sels-redress existed
not so much rei, as poenae persequendae causa¹: and as there is
no objective standard of right and wrong, the measure of the injury,
and therefore of the punishment, is the feeling of the injured person.
Traces of this linger on in Roman Law throughout its whole history.
It has been observed⁸ that in settling the damages to· be awarded the
earliest administrators of justice took as their guide the measure of
vengeance likely to be exacted by an aggrieved person und‘er the
circumstances of the case ⁸, and that this is the true explanation os
the very different penalties imposed by ancient law on offenders
caught in the act, or soon aster it, and on offenders detected after
considerable delay. Even the later Roman law permitted the husband
to kill with impunity the adulterer taken flagrante delict0, and distin-
guished the guilt of the thies according as he was caught in the act
'or not ; the fur nocturnus was liable to the same penalty as the adul-
terer: sor certain bodily injuries (Gaius iii. 22 3) the Mosaic law of
retaliation had its counterpart at Rome. And from the· ‘ addictio’
of the sur manifestus and the insolvent debtor, and the commonness
of noxal surrender (Gaius iv. 75-7 9, Bk. iv. 8 supr.) in international no
less than in private relations, Ihering conjectures that a form of self-
redress especially favoured by usage was the seizure and detention
of the person of the wrongdoer, until he was ransomed by his friendS,
or had earned by the sweat of his brow his own liberatior».

From a comparison os the differe-nt communities in which we know
this system of sels-redress to have prevailed, or even to obtain at the
present day, it would seem that there are two alternative connecting
links, as it were, between it and the later remedial process of advanc-
ing civiIIzation. The practice os uncontrolled private vengeance, ex-
tending even to life and limb, dwindles everywhere to one of the
various forms of distraint3 the survival, as at Rome, of a limited right of
