an independent person. But without doubt the chief reason why it had
never been found necessary to cut short, by legislative interserence‚ the
duration of patria potestas at puberty or majority was the fact that to
public matters it had no relation whatever. In respect of all public
functions the filiusfamilias was an independent person : in the field of
private law he was incapable of right, or power, or authority on his own
account, but in all other matters he was as capable of right as his father:
‘filiusfamilias in publicis causis loco patrisfamilias habetur, si magis-
tratum gerat, vel si tutor detur’ Dig. 36. 13. 5, ‘quod ad ius pub-
licum attinet, non sequitur ius potestatis’ ib. 143 cf. Maine's Ancient
Law p. 139.

At first, perhaps, there was little to distinguish the power osa father
over his children from that of a master over his slaveS, except the
fact that the filiusfamilias was always recognised as a ‘persona ;’ ac-
cordingly, though his pater could sell him, the purchaser could not own
him as he could own a slave, but could only hold him in mancipio. The
absolute control which the father possessed over him is best appreciated
by considering the formet-’s powers over his person, and the son's own
position in respect of property, contract, and capacity to sue.

Originally the paterfamilias had ius vitae necisque over those in his
power, so that, as Mr. Poste remarkS, the lex Pompeia de parricidiis,
B.c. 52 (Bk. iv. 18. 6 ins.) omits the father from the list of persons who
could be guilty of ‘parricide'z a fortiori, he possessed the right of un-
controlled corporal chastisement. But under the Empire these powers
had dwindled to the mere right of bringing serious domestic offences
under the cognisance of the magistrate, though in trifling matters the
father might still take the law into his own hands, The killing of a
child was first made ‘ parricide’ by Constantine ; in the time of Hadrian
a father who had acted thus under great provocation had been deported
to an island. From Plautus (Plut. Amphitruo i. 3. 3) it seems to have
then been common for parents to expose their infants to perish of cold
and hunger; this was strictly prohibited Α. D. 374 (Cod. 8. 52. 2) and a
law of Diocletian and Maximian forbade children to be sold, pledged, or
given away by their pater, though Constantine permitted their sale
immediately after birth in cases os extreme poverty, reserving, however,
an ‘ equity of redemption ’ which could in no way be forfeited. Justinian
(Nov. 134. 7) found it necessary to repeat the prohibition of child-
pledging, and increased the penalties against creditors who attempted
to enforce rights thus acquired; his abolition of noxal surrender of
filiifamilias has been noticed on Tit. 8 pr. supr. SQ, t00, the pater
could originally marry his son or daughter to whomsoever he pleased,
and divorce them at pleasure, besides transferring them to another
family by adoption3 ‘but later in the imperial period the privilege of
dictating marriage had declined into a conditional veto; and adoption
itself, destined to lose almost all its ancient importance in the reformed
