EXCURSUS ΙΙΙ.

POSSESSION.

Possnssron must be conceived ss distinct from ownership or do·
minium. In most cases, of course, the two are conjoined: the owner
has possession of his property. often, howeirer, they are separated:
the landlord owns the soil which his tenant possesses: his solicitor
has possession of the title-deeds to his estates: the findet of property.
possesses it, though another is its owner: and numberless other cases
will at once occur in which the owner and the possessor of a thing
are different persons. But (it may be argued) though this is so, yet
the relation of a person to a thing which he possesses is immaterial
for purposes os law: the law recognises no rights less than that of
ownership or its fragments Because Ι happen to have found a bank
note, and then lose it again, I cannot recover it from the second
findet: possession in itself is not a legal right at 311. If this were the
case, law-books would be spared one of their most difficult chapters;
but, as a matter of fact, all legal systems treat possession, under certain
circumstances, as a right, distinct from and independent of ownership,
and guarantee it protection. It remains to see what, under Roman
law, those circumstances are.

Mere possession, in itself, is no right at all. A person ⁶ merely ³
possesses who has the physical power of dealing with 3 tangible
object to the exclusion of every one else,'and is aware os such power.
Of such a relation between person and thing, by itsels, the law takes
no notice3 but being the foundation of all legally recognized posses-
sion it requires to be caresully noted. Very frequently it is called
naturalis possessio (e. g. Dig. 41. 3. r. ι), but it is also denoted by the
expressions, custodia (Dig. 36. 4. 5. pn), in possessione esse (Bk. iv.
15. 5 infi), tenere (Dig. 41.. 3. 34), naturaliter possidere (Dig. ib. 12. 1).
We shall call it uniformly Detention. For examples of persons who
had only Detention, as distinct from possession proper (e. g. the slave,
’ filiusfamilias, agent, borrower, lessee, and depositary) reference may
be made to Mr. Poste's Gaius, pp. 641-645. The idea of Detention
is limited to certain classes of objects. Nothing can be ‘ detained’
(and therefore, as we shall see, possessed) which is not corporea1;
